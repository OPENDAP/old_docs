  If you have questions about anything in this document, please send me those
  questions. Each of the sections has a small navigation panel at both its
  start and end which contains a button marked `Questions ?'. Use that to
  send me email. Please try to include the section name or number
  corresponding to your question; I plan on adding information to the
  sections based on the questions people ask about them.
