This document describes the FreeForm ND System of Format Descriptions
for Data Access. 

This document was originally written at the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration's National Environmental Satellite,
Data, and Information Service, which is part of the National
Geophysical Data Center in Boulder, Colorado.

This document has been updated to include information on FreeForm ND,
the last release of FreeForm. FreeForm is now supported only for use
with the Distributed Oceanographic Data System; see the 
\DODShome\ for more information.

We are interested in your comments about the FreeForm ND software and
this document.  Send them to:
