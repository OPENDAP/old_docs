What's here

javaDocs: Holds the HTML documentation for the Java code. These docs have a
fairly complex directory structure, so they need to be generated. If we put
them in CVS it'll not work for long because the directories move around so
much. Bummer... This is partly in CVS, but don't trust that.

pguide: The programmer's guide

pref-html: Holds the HTML documentation for the C++ code. This has a flat
directory structure, so it's in CVS.

wc-html, writing_client.tex: How to write a client tutorial

ws-html, writing_server.tex: How to write a server tutorial

Makefile: Should work, but you'll need to have DODS-3.4 and Java-DODS checked
out, too. You can substitute anything reasonable for DODS-3.4.
