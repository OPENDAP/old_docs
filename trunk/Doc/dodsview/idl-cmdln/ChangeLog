2003-04-23  Dan Holloway <d.holloway@gso.uri.edu>

	* Updated attribute handling to use new get_attr_iter
	methods in AttrTable, replacing old Pix operations.
	* Removed dods_next_attr function.
	* Removed any Pix operations which are no longer required.

	* Problem exists when using the idl_dods.so on systems
	where the RSI IDL binaries were built with compilers different
	than GCC.  Even on RedHat the problem remains, though use of
	gcc-3.2.2 appears to resolve the problem.
	
2003-02-03  Dan Holloway <d.holloway@gso.uri.edu>

	* Updated version number to 3.3.  
	
2003-01-30  Dan Holloway <d.holloway@gso.uri.edu>

	* Merged with release-3-2-6.
	
2002-12-10  Dan Holloway <d.holloway@gso.uri.edu>

	* Removed subclassed types (.i.e, IDLByte, IDLSequence, etc.)
	since no modifications to the base classes are made in them,
	and the current DAP changes no longer require these subclasses
	when they do not modify the base classes.

	* Updated Makefile.in to remove the subclassed types.
	
2001-10-13  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-4.

	* Minor fixes to configure and Makefile.in.

	* Updated README and INSTALL.

	* Changed include of export.h (an IDL header file) so that it was
	included using <> instead of "". This removed it from the
	dependencies which means others will be able to get the builds to
	work without running make depend.

2001-09-28  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with 3.2.4.

2001-09-27  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added include of debug.h; a small change but needed to get the
	code to compile with the latest DAP.

2001-08-27  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-3. The next merge should use -j
	release-3-2-3 -j release-3-2.

2001-06-19  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2 head (tagged release-3-2-2). The next
	merge should use update -j release-3-2-2 -j release-3-2.

	* Massive changes from Dan and Rich. See the README.

1999-11-08  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with cvs update -j release-3-1, the next merge should use
	-j release-3-1-1 -j release-3-1

	* Modified the code so that IDL*.cc,h files are used in place of
	the Client*.cc,h files. The later contain lots of code this client
	does not need and, as a result, made building harder than it
	needed to be.
