What's here:

Makefile: Build most of the stuff here, both ps files and html. You need a
fair amount of stuff set before this will work (latex, hyperlatex, ../boiler
and ../latex) but once it's all set 'make' puts on quite a show.

The official User's Guide is in guide.tex and guide-html/.

The matlab gui guide: gui.tex, mgui-html/

The quick-start guide: quick.tex, quick-html/

Documentation about regular expressions: regex.tex, regex-html/

A Description of the "DODS Data Standard": stds.tex, stds-html/. This is not
currently linked into the web pages, although it does show up on
/search/search-dods-books.html.

dataset-registration.tex: Old requirements/design for a GCMD interface. Long
superseded by their current interface.

Note: This directory had a set of links to other places in the documentation
tree. I removed these since I think they were for the other web pages. At the
minimum, they confused me and can be recreated pretty easily.
