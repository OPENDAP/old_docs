To Build the dsp-dods servers:

1) Type `./configure' at the system prompt. On some systems you may have to
type `sh configure'.

2) Type `make' to build the three server programs

3) To install the data server you need to copy the four executables (one
script and three binary programs) named `nph-dsp', `dsp_das', `dsp_dds' and
`dsp_dods' to your http server's CGI directory. For many UNIX computers, this
will be named cgi-bin and will reside within the http server's home directory
(e.g., on my system the cgi binary directory is called
/usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin). You can find out the name of this directory if
you don't know it by looking in the http server's srm.conf configuration file
(which will be located in a directory called `conf' within the http server's
home directory.

For serving compressed data sets with cache capability, you need to set the
cache directory in nph-dsp file and set the cron daemon to clean the
cache periodically.

For information about installing secure DODS servers, see the file SECURITY
in DODS_ROOT.

Debugging aids in DSP-DODS source code:

debug: simple program instrumentation -- see the file Dtype.h in
$(DODS_ROOT)/src/dsp-dods. This is used for short (single line) outputs.

NOTE FOR LINUX

The linux shell gags on the syntax we use in the Perl scripts to locate the
perl interpreter on your system. Look at the nph-jg script. The top two lines
look like:

    #!/bin/sh -- # -*- perl -*-
    eval "exec perl -T -S $0 $*" if 0;	# Trick to find perl. Must be on PATH.

On Linux you should replace these lines with:

    #!/path/to/your/perl -T

Where /path/to/your/perl is the full pathname of the perl interpreter you
want the servers to use. You can find the path to perl on your computer by
typing:

    which perl

You can check the version of perl by typing:

    perl -v

You need Perl version 5.001 or greater.
