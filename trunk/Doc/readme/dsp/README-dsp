This file contains information about the DODS-DSP image server. For information
about building and using the software, see the files INSTALL and USING.

DODS data servers make it simple to provide others with direct,
over-the-network, access to your DSP images. There is no need to reformat
your data so that a new system can read it. Instead DODS uses the http server
along with a dispatch script and a set of three server programs (Data
Attribute Server, Data Structure Server, and Data Server) to make your
existing data files available to anyone who has access to a program rebuilt
with DODS components.

For more information about DODS server/client, see the URL

dsp-dods is a server implementation of University of Miami DSP API, based on
the Distributed Oceanographic Data System. The software contains data servers
that can be used along with any DODS client program to process image data
served by the dsp-dods servers.

The server can handle all types of DSP image formats. It can also handle
compressed images (.Z and .gz files) using a cache directory. If the image 
projection type allows dimension scales are used to map the image into DODS 
Grid (with latitude and longitude maps), otherwise a DODS Array is used (with
lines and pixels). All the image associate blocks (header information) are given 
as Global attributes while specific information about each variable is given as
that variable's attributes.The user can refer to the entire remote image 
using a URL and/or the local file name. Furthermore, if the user wants 
to work only with a small part of the data set, a constraint expression can 
be supplied along with the URL to save on network data transmission time.

You can obtain a copy of the latest version of dsp-dods software using
anonymous FTP from

    Source files: ftp://dods.gso.uri.ed/pub/dods/DODS-dsp-<VERSION>.tar.gz
    Binary files: ftp://dods.gso.uri.ed/pub/dods/binary/<Platform>

    WWW page: http://dods.gso.uri.edu/DODS/home/software.html

To build from the source, You need to have the latest version DSP imageio
library from The University of Miami and the latest version of DODS core
software which is available at dods.gso.uri.edu.

Included in this distribution are: 

 - server programs and their dispatch script (dsp-dods, dsp-das, dsp-dds,
 nph-dsp)

Good Luck :-)
