<h1>
The modified programs are `smart' clients.
</h1>

<h3>
<ul>
	<li>Many client programs are limited to a fixed set of pre-formatted
	data types (e.g., GIF, text). <p>

	<li>Programs rebuilt with a DODS library can read and analyze data
	in a wide variety of data types and structures similar to most modern
	programming languages. <p>

	<li>Smart clients are the key to combining data from several
	sources. <p>

	<li>While the analysis program runs on the user's computer, the data
	remains remote, facilitating the use of many data sets without having
	to copy each to the local computer. <p>

</ul>

<h3>

<em> The communication protocol used by DODS is similar to a programming
language in that it enables the contents of a data set to be described as
variables to which a number of operators may be applied. This high-level
programatic description enables translation between the access mechanism of
the library and that of the data servers.</em>
