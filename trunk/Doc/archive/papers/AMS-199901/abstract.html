      The Distributed Oceanographic Data System (DODS) makes remote,
      scientific data accessible through a number of familiar data
      analysis and visualization packages.  There are two sides to
      DODS.  The first, making data visible to others, involves
      setting up a DODS data server.  Data servers are available for
      netCDF, HDF, JGOFS, and Matlab data.  Servers for other data
      formats are being developed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second side of DODS is to give the users data analysis and
      visualization package the ability to access data served by DODS
      servers.  Once the application is DODS enabled, data from any
      DODS server can be accessed regardless of the format in which
      the data are actually stored.  If either Matlab or IDL is
      available, the respective GUI program that comes with DODS can
      be used.  Several common APIs (e.g., the netCDF API) also come
      with DODS.  Applications that use these APIs can be DODS enabled
      by relinking them to the DODS libraries.  New DODS GUIs and API
      libraries are being developed.
    </p>

    <p>
      DODS was first developed by a joint collaboration between the
      University of Rhode Island and the Massachusetts Institute of
      Technology.  The scope of DODS has been broadened recently with
      grants from NASA, NSF and NOAA.  The collaborators include URI,
      MIT, JPL/PO-DAAC, NOAA/PMEL, NCAR/HAO, UCAR/Unidata, AGU,
      GSFC/GCMD, OSU, U. Miami, Scripps, and U. Hawaii.  User support
      is being handled by Unidata.  For more information, see the DODS
