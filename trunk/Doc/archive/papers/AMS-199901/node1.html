      Using DODS to Access and Deliver Remote Data
    </h1>
    <h1>1. What Is DODS?</h1>

    <p>
      DODS (Distributed Oceanographic Data System) makes remote,
      scientific data accessible through a number of familiar data
      analysis and visualization packages.  There are two perspectives
      to understanding DODS: the data provider's and the data
      user's. The provider's perspective, making data visible to
      others, involves setting up a DODS data server.  Data servers
      are available for data files in netCDF, HDF, JGOFS, DSP, Matlab,
      and FreeForm formats.  Servers for several other formats are
      also being developed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The data user's perspective on DODS centers on the ability to
      utilize familiar data analysis and visualization packages to
      access remote data.  Once the application is DODS-enabled, it
      becomes a DODS client and can access data from any DODS server
      regardless of the format in which the data are actually stored.
      Several applications have already been DODS-enabled including
      ones for the commercial Matlab and IDL packages and several free
      applications, including Ferret and ncview.  The DODS-enabled
      Matlab application includes a GUI for easy access to DODS data.
      A DODS version of the netCDF API is also available so that
      applications that use the netCDF API can be DODS-enabled by
      simply relinking them to the DODS netCDF API library.  The
      Ferret and ncview applications utilize this feature of DODS.
      More DODS GUIs and API libraries are being developed.
    </p>

    <p>
      DODS was originally developed for the oceanographic community.
      With recent grants, the target audience has expanded to the
      geoscience community.
