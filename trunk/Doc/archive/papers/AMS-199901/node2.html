    <h1>
      Using DODS to Access and Deliver Remote Data
    </h1>
    <h1>2. Why Use DODS?</h1>

    <p>
      As a provider of data, the power of DODS is that you can make
      your latest results available to your colleagues (including
      control over access) with very little effort.  That effort
      involves the one-time insertion of the DODS server binaries into
      your Web server's "cgi-bin" area.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a user of data, the power of DODS is that it allows you to
      easily ingest data from multiple sources across the internet
      into your data analysis and visualization package.  Since DODS
      can be integrated into many analysis packages, you need not
      learn a new package or rewrite already developed scripts.  Once
      you have the URL for the data you want, you can work with the
      data through your analysis application as with any local data.
      DODS handles both supplying your application with the desired
      data and translating the data into a format your application can
      use.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, suppose you wanted to use data from two different
      sites in an analysis.  One location stored data in HDF and the
      other in netCDF.  To accomplish your analysis without DODS, you
      would have to go to each site and order or download the data
      files to your machine. If your analysis package reads netCDF but
      not HDF, you have to determine how to convert the HDF data into
      netCDF and then convert the data.  Once the conversion is
      completed, you can look at the data you downloaded and make sure
      it is what you need.  If it is not what you want, you have to go
      back to the download step.  Finally, when you have the data
      files containing the data of interest, you can perform your
      analysis on the specific data you want from those data files.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your analysis package has been DODS enabled, you can use the
      URLs for the two datasets of the above example to access the
      data directly from your analysis package.  Also, by qualifying
      the URL with constraint information, you can limit the
      parameters and range of data that will be accessed over the
      network.  For instance, you might want to request just the
      surface temperature from the Midwest US.  Since the process of
      accessing data is so simple, you can quickly examine data sets
      to determine their suitability to your analysis needs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Assuming your DODS enabled application includes a scripting
      language (like Matlab or IDL), you can do all of this under
      program control. Specifically, you could write a script for your
      application that ingests data from one site, analyzes it, and,
      depending on the analysis, requests data from the same or
      another site to add to your analysis.  The script could continue
      through a particular dataset looking for relevant data.
