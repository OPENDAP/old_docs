<h1>
Sharing data
</h1>

<p>

<h3>
<em>
Sharing data between individuals is the most important mechanism for data
exchange:
</em>
<ul>
	<li>All data consumers are potential providers
	<li>Individual providers must never be `second-class' citizens in a
	system
	<li>Data made accessible to remote sites must be stored so that
	it can be used locally too
</ul>
</h3>

<h3><em> 
Earth Scientists repeatedly say that the most important external source of
information comes from their colleges. Thus any distributed data system must
provide access to this information if it is to radically alter researcher's
access to data.
</em></h3>
