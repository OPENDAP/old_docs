<h1>
Client-side versus server-side operations
</h1>

<p>

<h3>
<em>
Client programs should be able to off-load some operations onto the server:
</em>
<ul>
	<li>Constraints; servers should filter data before sending it to
	clients
	<li>Servers as clients; data servers must be able to function as
	clients
	<li>Servers can perform optimized operations on data using its native
	form
</ul>
</h3> 

<br><br><br><br><br>

<h3><em> 
It is important to minimize the data transferred between client and server
because, aside from making the best best use of available bandwidth, the
server can be programmed with special knowledge about the data. In a large
distributed system this information cannot realistically be coded into the
client applications.
