<h1>
Focus of this talk
</h1>

<p>

<h3> 
Discuss the changes in requirements for analysis software brought on by the
advent of distributed computing.
<!--
Use The Distributed Oceanographic Data System to illustrate requirements for
client-side data analysis software and remote data servers.
-->
</h3> 

<br><br><br><br>

<h3> 
<em>The two driving forces for these changes are the distribution of
data and the distribution of processing. The Distributed Oceanographic Data
System will be used to illustrate ways these new requirements can be met
while still maximizing existing resources. Other aspects of the system, for
example its design and construction, will not be addressed</em>
</h3>

<!--
<h3>
<em>This talk will not cover:</em>

<ul>
    <li> The overall design of DODS
    <li> Building DODS-compliant components
</ul>
