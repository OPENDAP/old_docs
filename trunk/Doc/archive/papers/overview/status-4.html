<em>The NetCDF and JGOFS data servers released with the DODS version 1 core
software have been updated to work with version 2. A data server for the
FreeForm API was built using the version 1 software but has not yet been
updated to work with version 2. Groups at the University of Maryland and the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory have built servers for CDF (works with DODS version
1) and HDF (an ongoing effort; works with DODS version 2).</em>
