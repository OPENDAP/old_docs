\chapter{DODS Background}

The DODS project was begun in the early 1990's.  An outgrowth of the
development of two earlier oceanographic data systems, XBrowse and
JGOFS, DODS sought to take advantage of the internet to improve access
to oceanographic data.  At a meeting in 1992, participants discussed
the development of a new data distribution system that would
incorporate the best features of both of these earlier models, as well
as additional features suggested by their shortcomings.  This first
workshop had forty attendees and was held at the University of Rhode
Island.  The vision that emerged from that and subsequent meetings was
of a distributed system that would encourage individual scientists to
be their own data providers, alongside the traditional centralized
data archives, such as the federal data centers.

Since that time, the DODS system has developed into a sophisticated
data transport mechanism, as well as several specialized program
interfaces that allow unmediated access to scientific data from a
variety of user applications, ranging from simple web browsers (e.g.
Netscape, Internet Explorer) to advanced data analysis packages (e.g.
Matlab, IDL, Ferret).  Data made available through DODS ranges from
large collections of simple satellite data files to complex relational
databases.

In 2000, the National Ocean Partnership Program (NOPP) awarded DODS a
grant to develop a Virtual Ocean Data Hub system, to create a
structure through which ocean data can easily be made available to the
larger ocean sciences community.

Plans for the first year center around an effort to develop a
cooperative approach to creating the Hub system.  Four regional groups
were formed: Northeast, Southeast, Gulf Coast, and West Coast where
workshops have been held to discuss the DODS concept.  A fifth
workshop examined the overlapping development of ESRI's Geographic
Information System (GIS) technology and DODS.  The workshops were led
by regional coordinators who ran each of the workshops and who have
control on how money allocated to the regions will be spent in the out
years (second and third years).  Each of the regional coordinators
have an interest in oceanography but are from differing backgrounds,
with the idea of bringing as many diverse contributions as possible to
the overall effort.

A final synthesis report (this paper) is based on the reports
generated by each of the regional workshops.  This report is to be
provided as background to participants at a national workshop, to
be held in Washington, DC, April 25-27, 2001.  After the national
workshop, an overall report discussing recommendations for the DODS
project will be written.  A technical meeting will then be held to
address technical issues related to the implementation of
recommendations of the national report.

\chapter{DODS/NOPP Program Objectives}

The objective of the DODS/NOPP project is to plan and implement a
Virtual Ocean Hub (VODHub) system that will provide users with the
ability to easily access certain data types measured at specified
locations and times, regardless of data source, and without special
efforts or insights on the part of the user about the data source(s).

Specific research objectives identified in the BAA (Broad Agency
Announcement) are to:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify individuals and organizations who will take the lead to
  foster development of community-based data conventions for the
  available variety of data types;
\item Partner with local institutions (public and private) to improve
  access to coastal and regional data using these same community-based
  data conventions;
\item Enhance connections to existing national and international
  archives of ocean data as well as the program offices of major ocean
  programs (e.g., WOCE, JGOFS);
\item Partner with international groups to foster a world-wide ``ocean
  data dictionary'' to further commonality of access for all sources
  of ocean data; and
\item Work with national and international user standards groups
  (e.g., International Hydrographic Organization and their Electronic
  Navigation Charts) to foster access to ocean data.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{The DODS Regional Workshops}

Five regional workshops were held between October 2000 and January
2001.  Attendance at the workshops ranged in size from 15 to 40
participants.

Although the workshop agendas varied, each included:

\begin{enumerate}
\item An overview and demonstration of DODS presented by University of
  Rhode Island personnel; 
\item A presentation by workshop attendees of information on agency program
  activity and datasets that could potentially be served via DODS in
  the VODHub; 
\item A summary of the data interests and data holdings of the
  workshop attendees, presented by each attendee; 
\item A discussion pertaining to DODS functionality as it relates to the
  VODHub; and 
\item A discussion addressing regional data needs that might
  be addressed by the VODHub.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{DODS Basic Issues}

The following issues were presented to the regional workshop
participants for consideration:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Is the DODS data model adequate for datasets to be served in the
  region, and if not, what additions are required?  
\item What are the important interface issues for users in the region?
  This question addresses issues related to the basic functionality of
  the system ranging from data discovery to data use.  
\item What types of semantic metadata will be required and what
  semantic metadata standard(s) will be used?  The focus should be on
  search and use metadata. 
\item What datasets will be served via the system as part of this
  effort?  Seed the system?  What assistance will be needed?  
\item Is a central regional node required to provide coordination for
  the region including such services as user support and data
  location, as well as other currently unforeseen services?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Response to Issue \#1}

\emph{Is the DODS data model adequate for datasets to be served in the
region, and if not, what additions are required?}\pause

When asked whether the DODS data model was adequate, participants at
the five workshops saw no major flaws in the DODS data model.  Some
workshop participants suggested the DODS data model be modified to
handle maps, graphs, images stored in GIF or JPEG format, and
animation data types.

Some secondary data model issues also arose.  For example, it is easy
to use the DODS data model to transport satellite swath data, but most
users want these data in more typical projections that require further
processing.  The requirement of further processing could be considered
a data model issue.  

% It was also noted that model outputs generated by
% scientists could be served via DODS.  DODS us well suited to serve
% model output.  Although this is not a problem for the data model, it
% might be a problem to a catalog system that depended on space and time
% coordinates.  Neither of these are, technically, data model issues,
% but they might be considered to occupy a nearby niche.

\section{Response to Issue \#2}

\emph{What are the important interface issues for users in the region?  This
question addresses issues related to the basic functionality of the
system ranging from data discovery to data use.}\pause

Data location was consistently identified as important (one group said
``essential'') for optimal use of the VODHub.  Some of the regions
suggested that a regional web- based data catalog (with a template) be
developed.  Furthermore, the catalog should be searchable by keyword
and geography.  Some argued that the catalog should list any available
dataset, whether or not it is accessible by DODS.

Two other interface issues emerged from the workshops:

\begin{description}
\item[Previewing capability]  One region proposed the development of a
  web browser interface that would allow a user to preview data before
  retrieving data.  Functionality should include location/sub-setting,
  manipulation, display, and data download.  (This is, in fact,
  similar to the Live Access Server, whose development is underway.
  An operational LAS can be found at
  \xlink{http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/las}{\texttt{http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/las}}.)
  
\item[Data request] Most of the workshops agreed that writing URLs is
  difficult.  One workshop suggested that a graphical, web browser,
  interface be developed to assist in the building of URLs.  Another
  workshop suggested a URL builder designed for sophisticated and
  unsophisticated users both locally and globally.

\end{description}

\section{Response to Issue \#3}

\emph{What types of semantic metadata will be required and what semantic
metadata standard(s) will be used?  The focus should be on search and
use metadata.}\pause

``Search'' metadata is the information needed to select
a dataset to use (e.g. location and time of measurements), while
``use'' metadata is information needed to use a dataset (e.g.  missing
value flags, or units).  The two sets overlap, but they are distinct
notions.

All of the regions agreed that semantic metadata was vital to the DODS
effort.  Most of the workshop focus was on use metadata, with
relatively little attention paid to search metadata.  Workshop
attendees emphasized the importance of being able to find the data you
need, but the metadata requirements proposed had more to do with
making the data you've found easy to use.

There was not a great deal of discussion about how important it is
that use metadata be machine-readable---that is, supplied in a
consistent format a computer can parse.  

%However, there appeared to be
%wide agreement that the creation of effective catalog strategies was
%essential to a working system.  This, in turn, implies a commitment to
%machine-accessible discovery metadata somehow tied to the datasets.
%One basis for this conclusion was the mention of FGDC and GCMD at all
%of the workshops, as a means for collecting and disseminating discovery
%metadata.

Several lengthy discussions dealt with the varieties of use metadata
that make datasets valuable, though there was little talk about
interoperability with respect to this variety of metadata.  One
possible implication of this is that machine-level interoperability
was not seen as crucial by workshop participants.  If someone is going
to use data from two different datasets, perhaps they will inevitably
do so at the user level rather than at the machine level, if only to
maintain a degree of control over the process.

The importance of associating existing data set descriptions---in the
FGDC clearinghouse or the GCMD---to data sets was dealt with in at
least one of the workshops.  This led to a discussion of third party
metadata description in general and the value of rendering these
accessible via the data access protocol, even when the descriptions
and the data do not reside on the same server.

Topping the workshop lists of essential metadata types were:

\begin{description}
\item[Names and descriptions] What is meant by the abbreviation of the
  variable name?
\item[Units and scaling factors] What units are the data delivered in?
\item[Missing values] How are missing values flagged in the dataset?
\end{description}

Several participants commented that a useful metadata collection would
have a place for data quality indicators.  Suggestions for these took
many different forms, including simple flags to indicate accuracy and
precision (Gulf Coast workshop), to descriptions of quality control
procedures (West Coast), to quality ``flags'' (Southeast).  One
suggestion (from the Southeast workshop) was that if a web-based
description exists for a dataset, the URL for this description should
be in the dataset's data attribute structure (DAS).

Finally, there were several comments about metadata people wished they
could have for datasets they would like to use.  These suggestions
included:

\begin{itemize}
\item Methods;
\item Platforms;
\item Instrument type and details, such as calibration data;
\item Data originator (P.I.);
\item Funding source;
\item Palettes for display of imagery, such as maps and sections;
\item Publications based on this data; 
\item Comparisons with other data; and 
\item Processing algorithms.
\end{itemize}

The Southeast and Gulf Coast workshops were explicit in urging that
the DODS project accommodate the Z39.50 metadata standard, and do so
by working with the FGDC Clearinghouse.  They suggested that DODS
should be able to use metadata supplied by a third party, such as
FGDC, and should be able to do so automatically.  The Gulf Coast
workshop further recommended that data originators should make use of
commercial software packages to assist them in preparing metadata in
FGDC format.

One suggestion (from the Southeast workshop) was that support should
be provided to those interested in proper descriptions of their
datasets.This support could take the form of:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A white paper that would be made available via either the
national or a regional DODS website, and 
\item Training sessions offered either at a central site or at
individual institutions.
\end{enumerate}




\section{Response to Issue \#4}

\emph{What datasets will be served via the system as part of this effort?
Seed the system?  What assistance will be needed?}\pause

Many of the regional agencies and participating scientists have
datasets stored in a variety of commercial DBMS software packages.
Workshop participants recommended that DODS servers be developed to
handle Microsoft EXCEL and ACCESS files, SAS, S+, and ArcINFO GIS
formatted data.

The workshop attendees had varying levels of expertise when it came to
installing servers.  It was noted that money would come from the
project to support server installation.  In the proposal, each region
would either:

\begin{itemize}
\item Hire an individual to use the money to help install servers, or
\item Let a sub-contract for people to install their own servers.
\end{itemize}

Ultimately, it is up to each region to decide how they want to proceed
and perhaps identify a few high priority sites for server
installation.

It was noted that the DODS project bears a great deal of
responsibility for the success of this phase.  in particular, the
workshops pointed out that: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Servers must be easy to install;
\item A regional help desk should be provided for answering questions
  on installing servers and developing clients; and
\item High quality, easy to understand documentation should be made
  available.
\end{itemize}

Some of the workshops suggested that funds would be well spent to
provide even more intensive help to people who want to install DODS
servers.

Each workshop spent some time detailing the datasets attendees knew
about that could be served by DODS.  These lists are available in the
respective appendices.

It was noted in the Northeast workshop that there are many good
datasets developed by various government resource management agencies
(who were not represented at the workshop).  These data are presumed
to be small datasets housed on a variety of platforms and stored with
many different kinds of software.  Making these datasets DODS
accessible will be a large task.

\section{Response to Issue \#5}

\emph{Is a central regional node required to provide coordination for the
region including such services as user support, data location, etc.?}\pause

The requirements for and function of a regional ``node'' varied from
workshop to workshop, but the following themes did emerge:

\begin{itemize}
\item Providing user support such as ``help desks,'' and recording
  problems users have experienced using DODS and installing servers;
\item Developing web-based data catalogs containing regional datasets,
  model output, and products participants are willing to serve;
\item Creating pilot projects to demonstrate the use of DODS for
  current regional players and for other organizations and researchers
  not in attendance at the workshops;
\item Establishing ad hoc working groups and/or possible local nodes
  to tackle regional cooperative pilot studies, evaluating available
  datasets (including satellite data) and serving real-time data;
\item Developing functionality to address dataset certification, data
  archaeology and rescue, long-term archiving;
\item Defining data rules to make computer models and output
  accessible (e.g., ENSO vs. non-ENSO model runs); and
\item Creating a regional website and/or listserv for highlighting
  issues of regional importance and to facilitate greater
  communication among regional players.
\end{itemize}


\section{Other ideas, suggestions, and recommendations}

Several other issues were identified by the regional workshops.  These
are outlined in the sections that follow.

\subsection{Archiving Issues}

Two workshops expressed the need for a committment to an archive for
data and product sets considered to be of long-term value.  Many of
these datasets are compiled by individual researchers and on their
retirement or death may no longer be accessible.

\subsection{Security Issues}

Several security issues were identified.

\begin{description}
\item[Data Security] Several attendees in the Southeast and Gulf Coast
  workshops expressed the desire to control access to data served by
  DODS.  It was pointed out that being able to restrict access to
  particular datasets is an important feature.  
  
  A few participants in the Southeast workshop discussed the need to
  be able to display a disclaimer to users of DODS data.
  This is apparently a requirement of some prospective data
  providers. 
  
\item[System Security] It is vital for the DODS project to be able to
  assure data providers that there are no security ``leaks'' in the
  DODS software.  It was suggested that Perl software isn't as secure
  as compiled software (C++ was specifically mentioned).  It was also
  suggested that the DODS documentation or web site contain a section
  describing known httpd security issues.
  
\item[Data Integrity] Some users expressed concern that data served by
  DODS could be modified by users.  DODS is a read-only protocol,
  however, so this is not possible.

\end{description}

\subsection{Inclusion of others}

Two of the workshops especially sought to look for other groups that
would be interested in making use of DODS and the VODHub.  In the
Northeast, the various government resource management agencies were
identified, and in the Gulf Coast workshop, attendees mentioned that
industry scientists (e.g. oil and gas exploration) could potentially
be interested.  The Gulf Coast workshop also suggested inviting
representatives from Canada, Mexico, and Cuba to use regional data
centers and potentially contribute datasets.

\subsection{Suggestions for Years 2 and 3}

Funding in the out years was essentially left up to each region to
decide where money was to be spent.  Some suggestions included:

\begin{itemize}
\item Web browser and direct download for clients;
\item Establish mailing lists for workshop participants; 
\item Create a web client focus group; 
\item Develop regional pilot projects;
\item Coordinate efforts with FGDC;
\item Explore metadata to DODS relationships; and
\item Hire outside consultants and/or programmers to:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Build websites with information pertinent to DODS users;
  \item Perform demonstrations on the use of DODS;
  \item Provide help desk support; and
  \item Develop software for web client(s) and DODS URL builders.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\chapter{Summary of the DODS-ESRI Workshop}

The purpose of the DODS-ESRI workshop was different than the regional
workshops.  This meeting was to facilitate the creation of data
exchange technology that would allow data to be shared between
Geographic Information System (GIS) systems and scientific users.  The
meeting's purpose was to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Examine the overlapping development between ESRI and DODS;
\item Help ESRI understand ocean scientist user requirements;
\item Assist DODS designers and developers to understand current GIS
  technology; and
\item Lay the groundwork for year two and three of the NOPP/DODS project.
\end{itemize}

The summary report for this workshop is included in
appendix~\ref{app,esri} of this report. 

Some of the priority questions for the DODS-ESRI integration include:

\begin{itemize}
\item How to provide DODS data access to GIS users?
\item How to provide GIS access to DODS users?
\end{itemize}

Next steps identified:

\begin{itemize}
\item Build a DODS-ArcIMS connector.  This will provide DODS clients
  access to GIS data.  It may be the starting point for building
  client software for ESRI users to access DODS data.
\item Begin working with the ArcIMS Software Development Kit (SDK).
  Although the technology is still in development, it has the
  functionality to provide GIS users access to DODS servers.
\item Schedule an additional meeting at the ESRI National user
  conference.
\end{itemize}

Unresolved Issues:
\begin{itemize}
\item Data discovery mechanism is not clear.
\item Understanding and accessing GIS metadata requirements for a DODS
  client.
\end{itemize}
