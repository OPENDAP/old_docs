     This is an announcement of the first beta release of the netCDF
client-server libraries of the Distributed Oceanographic Data System (DODS).
The software is freely available via anonymous ftp in both source form (you
will need the GNU C++ compiler and libg++) or binary form for selected
platforms.

The Distributed Oceanographic Data System (DODS) facilitates direct access to
on-line scientific data sets over the Internet.  Its design takes advantage
of existing data access APIs and the transfer protocol of the World Wide Web.
DODS enables netCDF data files, when served by a DODS data server, to be
directly accessed over the Internet by existing netCDF API that have been
relinked with DODS/netCDF client libraries.  In principle, any program
written that uses netCDF can be adapted to read data from a DODS data server
and become a client in the DODS client-server system.  Included in the source
and binary distributions are versions of ncview and ncdump two useful netCDF
tools that have already been linked to DODS client libraries.

The design and implementation of DODS provides a number of benefits to
researchers accessing on-line distributed data resources.  A netCDF client
program accessing data from a DODS/netCDF server will be able to subset large
datasets over the Internet without the need to transfer the entire dataset as
is required with with FTP or AFS.  In addition the client can determine
updates or changes to the netCDF dataset directly, (e.g.  new records)
something which can only be infered with FTP.  Finally, the client does not
require paging large amounts of data across the network, as is needed with
NSF mounted data volumes, when performing complex data extractions such as
hyper-slabs of variable data.

While DODS currently solely supports netCDF, we plan support for other data
access APIs including JGOFS and HDF.  As these new APIs are added, DODS will
enable existing DODS clients to directly access the data sets being made
available in these new `foreign' APIs or formats.

DODS is being developed by the University of Rhode Island and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
