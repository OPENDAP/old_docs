File sharing for software development

CVS uses a single `source repository' to store files. Users that want to edit
a file or collection of files check those files out from the central
repository. Edited files are checked in to the repository when they are
ready for general use. The CVS man page documents the features of this
system.

You can get CVS from prep.ai.mit.edu. You will also need RCS and gnu diff.
They may also be found at the `prep' site.

I have set up a CVS repository on dcz.gso.uri.edu in
/home/cvs-repository. All DODS files are stored in the subdirectory `DODS'
within the repository. To access these files on other machines
(e.g. zeno.gso.uri.edu) you should remote mount dcz:/home/cvs-repository to
some convenient place (e.g., /usr/local/repository). Then in your login file
(e.g., .bashrc, .login) add the environment variable CVSROOT and set it to
`/usr/local/repository'.

The CVS man page is a bit long - but it is the best documentation I've found
on the system (I have a paper, but it is not very useful).
