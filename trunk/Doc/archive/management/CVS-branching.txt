If you have checked out code a want to check changes in on a branch instead
of the main trunk, do the following:

1) Tag the code so that the branch has a name.
2) Update your copy of the code so that it is associated with that branch.
3) Check in the code.

Here's an example:

	cvs tag -b test-branch

-b makes this tag a branch off of the main trunk. The symbolic name
 `test-branch' can be used to refer to the branch. Without a symbolic name,
 you'll be hosed.

	cvs update -r test-branch

This updates the tag of the code in the current working directory to
`test-branch'. Since the tag is on a branch, now so is this code.

	cvs ci -m "<some message>

The code is now checked in on the branch.

Note that there's a test CVS module that can be checked out and played with.
You cannot do anything too terrible to this since the `code' is just a couple
of test files. Before doing anything that might cause the DODS repository to
get hosed, try it out there. The name of the test module is `cvs-test'.
