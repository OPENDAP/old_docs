TASKS:

I made up the following table of tasks and funding. Is anything missing? 

#	Task						Source
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1	Populate system with data			NSF/NOAA
2	Install (custom) data servers			NSF/NOAA

3	Support more UNIX platforms			NOAA
4	Support PC (e.g., via Java)			NOAA
5	Web data browser/extractor			NOAA
6	Specialized Web interfaces for key datasets*	NOAA
7	Support for API/analysis packages (e.g., IDL)	NOAA

8	User support					NOAA**
9	Documentation					NOAA**

10	Servers for GRIB and BUFR			NSF
11	Server development tools			NSF
12	IDL interface					NSF	
13	Browser						NSF
14	Better metadata					NSF
15	Better translation				NSF

Notes: * Hmm. just what does this mean?
       ** But none called for in the NSF proposal?

Tasks that can be combined:

5 & 13

7 & 12

Also, we are currently working on 7, 14, 15. There should be significant
progress on them by Nov of this year.

Revised tasks:

14	Better metadata					NSF
15	Better translation				NSF

Some dependencies exist between these tasks:

`Server Development tools' (11) will have an impact on Populate and Install
(1, 2). Its not required that #11 be done before those start, but the sooner
11 finished the sooner 1 and 2 can make use of those tools.

`Data Browser/extractor' (5) depends on Java at some level (4). I think that
PC support is too broad a goal to hold up the browser(s). We could develop a
simple Java library to start with (even less than a port of the client-side
DAP [C++] code) and then proceed with the two tasks in parallel. 

`Servers for GRIB and BUFR' (we have been talking about these for years)
could be had using the FreeForm server Reza is going to finish ASAP (less
than a month). We could also code them from scratch. There may be a
dependency here on task 11.

FUNDING:
		Year 1		Year 2		Year 3
Position &     ----------------------------------------
Level (FTE yrs)	

	NSF
		User Sup 1/2	User Sup 1/4	-
		Prog 3/4	Prog 3/4	Prog 3/4

	NOAA
		Prog 2		Prog 2
		Data 3/4	Data 3/4
		Tech 1/2	Tech 1/2

		Web Site 1/4*	Web Site 1/4*
		Digitize 3/4*	Digitize 3/4*

* I don't think we have to handle these.
