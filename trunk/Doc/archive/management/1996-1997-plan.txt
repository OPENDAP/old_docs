Outline of plans for DODS from 6/96 to 1/97.

Finite duration tasks:
	Develop interfaces for IDL & MatLAB
		These would ideally provide access w/o using an intermediate
		API library (although we might build a first version that uses
		one of the existing client-libraries). 
	Continue developing the data locator
		This includes refining the HTML interface, building a Java
		interface, working with the GCMD people and looking into
		other online catalogs (e.g., Alexandria).
	Translation of data objects
		Move this from the client-libraries into the core software.
		This was supposed to have been done for version 2, but we ran
		out of time. This will include both the translation mechanism
		and an interface that will allow users to control the
		translation process .
	Bring on-line various GSO datasets:
		These include: Various DSP datasets (satellite images)
		Edge datasets
		Oleander
		RAFOS
		IES (maybe)
	Bring on-line other datasets
		JGOFS (through the JGOFS project office)
		netCDF (through Unidata)
		OF course, this is also an ongoing task for datasets in
		general. 
	Build a list of datasets
		Initially this will be a simple list of datasets; later we
		will need to migrate the information to the locator.
	PR for Version 2
		Send messages to various email lists and in general try to
		drum up support for the system. 
	Freeform and CDF servers
		Migrate the version 1 servers for FF and CDF to version 2

Ongoing tasks:
	Improve the core software
		There is a huge TODO list; it is a never ending task.
	Build/Maintain a list of freeware programs that work with DODS.
	Provide user support
	Provide developer support
	Recruit datasets
