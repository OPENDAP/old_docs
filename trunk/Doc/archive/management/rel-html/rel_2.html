<h1>2 Release Checklists</h1>
<p>This section contains some checklists that we have developed over time to
help make the process of releasing software more predictable. Collecting these
lists in one place should help co&ouml;rdinate our group and also make it easier
to fix broken parts of, or add missing parts to, the process. 
<p>All the OPeNDAP software is held in one CVS module. Even so, each discrete
piece of software (a server, the library of common code, <i>et c.</i> is in
its own directory. Each source directory has its own version number. With the
exception of the server dispatch software (which is in <tt>DODS/etc</tt>) all
of the software is held in directories under <tt>DODS/src</tt> and each of
those directories contains a separate deliverable.
<p>In practice, we release the OPeNDAP software mostly <i>en masse</i>. However,
if a fix for a particular component really needs to be released quickly, we
can increment just that component's version number and release it alone. That
is, suppose the current release is version 2.1 and we add an important fix to
<tt>asciival</tt> which is at version 2.1.6. We can bump the version number of
<tt>asciival</tt> to 2.1.7 and put that in the 2.1 release. We don't need to
release all the other components.
<p>When we decide to there are enough new features and/or fixes for a new
release, the version number of the release as a whole is increased.
Appendix&nbsp;<a href="rel_4.html">4</a> has information on version numbering.

<h2><a name="id1">2.1 Making a new release</a></h2>
<p>Making a new software release can be roughly divided into two parts. In the
first part we start making Release Candidates (essentially beta releases). As
problems are found in these, we fix those problems and produce a successive
candidate. This iterative process continues until the current Release
Candidate has no major problems and can be made a formal release.
<p>Here are the steps used to iterate over making release candidates toward
making a formal release:
<ol><li>Create a release branch in CVS
<li>Start documentation efforts:
  <ol><li>Gather information needed for documentation (web pages,
    README/INSTALL docs, and formal manuals):
    <ul><li>the new features and major bug fixes (this information
      should be part of the ChangeLog files).
    <li>the system requirements.
    <li>compatibility with previous versions.
    <li>the list of the systems on which the code has
      been built (include compiler version information).
    </ul>
    This list will be the rough draft of the release notes.
  <li>Create web pages for this release.
  <li>Create release notes.  (Take the list made above, and check it
    into the documentation DODS CVS tree at DODS-doc/notes.)  The
    release notes will eventually consist of a list of the important
    changes, followed by a list of explanations for each change.
    Here's an example from release 3.4:
    <pre class="ix">
      Code changes
      1.  Using libcurl instead of libwww.
      2.  URL dereferencing done with curl instead of Perl.
      ...

      CODE CHANGES
      1. The DODS core now links to libcurl instead of libwww for WWW
      functions.  The libcurl library is smaller than libwww, is being
      actively developed, and is MT-safe.

      2. The server dispatch scripts no longer use the Perl HTTP, MIME and
      LWP classes.  Instead, URL dereferencing is done with curl, a
      freestanding binary that is part of the libcurl build.
      ...
    </pre>
  <li>Start the process of adding that information to the Guides.
  </ol>
  It's important to get started on these tasks early because they are
  complicated and, unlike a build or a test suite, there's no automated way to
  determine when they are `ready.'
<li>Iterate through the Release Candidates until no major bugs remain. See
  Section&nbsp;<a href="#id2">2.1.1</a> for the steps involved in making individual
  release candidates.
<li>Evaluate the software (See Section&nbsp;<a href="#id3">2.1.2</a>) to determine if
  there are issues with the source not yet addressed by the process of
  release candidate preparation.
<li>Mark the branch as a formal release
  (e.g., <tt>cvs tag release-3-4-3FCS</tt>). NB: I prefer to do this
  <em>after</em> making the source files. If you use this ordering of
  the steps and find a problem, make sure to re-tag the branch (see
  <tt>cvs tag -h</tt> for information about moving (or forcing) a tag.
<li>Make source and binary distribution files. See Section&nbsp;<a href="#id4">2.1.3</a>
<li>Place source and binary on <tt>ftp</tt> site
<li>Update web pages for formal release
</ol>

<h3><a name="id2">2.1.1 Making release candidates</a></h3>

<ol><li>Prepare the code to be a Release Candidate (see
  Section&nbsp;<a href="rel_3.html#id1">3.1</a>). 
<li>Run nightly builds until the tests are clean.
<li>Update all <tt>version.h</tt> files.
<li>Tag CVS branch as a release candidate (e.g., <tt>cvs tag
  release-3-4RC1</tt>).
<li>Make source tar files (see Section&nbsp;<a href="#id4">2.1.3</a>)
<li>Put source distribution files on the <tt>ftp</tt> site
<li>Check that web site is up-to-date (i.e., so that people can get the
  release candidate).
<li>Announce release candidate source code.
<li>Tag and merge the branch (see Section&nbsp;<a href="rel_3.html#id2">3.2</a>).
<li><blockquote><i>Optional</i></blockquote> Make binary builds; release.
<li>If there are major bugs, fix them and redo this list.
<li>If there are no major bugs, we are done making release candidates
</ol>
<p>Note that the Release Candidate process concerns the source code and binary
builds only. Once we've decided to make a formal release, There are other
things that must be done <em>before</em> it is ready to become a formal
release. See Section&nbsp;<a href="#id3">2.1.2</a> for details on the steps
required before a formal release can be made.

<h3><a name="id3">2.1.2 Before making a formal release</a></h3>

<p>Think about each of the following questions before moving on from release
candidates to a formal release:
<ul><li>Do we have binaries for all the platforms we support?
<li>Double check information needed for documentation:
  <ul><li>new features and major bug fixes.
  <li>system requirements.
  <li>compatibility with previous versions.
  <li>the list of the systems on which the code has been built.
  </ul>
<li>Is the documentation sufficient? Check README and INSTALL files in the
  <tt>src</tt>, <tt>etc</tt> and <tt>docs</tt> directories and the NEWS file
  in the top-level directory. The text documentation files in <tt>docs</tt>
  are used when making binary distributions, the ones in the <tt>src</tt>
  directories are included with the source distributions and the ones in
  <tt>etc</tt> are included in both.
<li>Do the formal manuals need to be updated? If so, this process should be
  started (however, in general the release should not wait on the manuals).
<li>Is the web-site current?
<li>Can we all answer questions about the installation and use of the
  software? Do we all understand the software's limitations?
</ul>

<h3><a name="id4">2.1.3 Making source and binary distribution files for a formal release</a></h3>

<ol><li>Check out a clean copy of the release branch using CVS's
  <tt>export</tt> command (e.g., <tt>cvs export -r release-3-4RC3 -d
    DODS-3.4 DODS</tt>).
<li>Remove any source/directories that we don't intend to include in this
  release. Since the trunk often contains more software than we are actually
  releasing, this is an important step. 
<li>Verify that this software builds: <tt>./configure</tt>,
  <tt>make World</tt>, <tt>make tar</tt><br />NB: It's often a good idea to see
  the build as it happens and to get a log. To do that, use <tt>tee</tt> as
  in: <tt>make World 2&gt;&#38;1 | tee World.log</tt>. If you're using <tt>csh</tt>
  change <tt>2&gt;&#38;1 |</tt> to <tt>|&#38;</tt>.
  <ul><li>Build binaries and run tests.
  <li>Build binary distribution files (<tt>make binary-tar</tt>)
  <li>Remove the binaries: <tt>make distclean</tt>
  <li>Add the version numbers to the directory names: <tt>make
    update-version</tt>
  <li>Make the source code tar files: <tt>make source-tar</tt> (at the
    top-level) or <tt>make tar</tt> in a <tt>DODS/src/<em>component</em></tt>
    directory.
  <li>Test both the source and binary distributions!
    <ol><li>Expand all the binary distribution files to make sure they
      hold software that works.
    <li>Expand the source distribution files and verify they build.
    </ol>
  </ul>
</ol>
