Ethan Davis reviewed the progress on \ac{THREDDS} and its use in
\ac{OPeNDAP}.  The \ac{THREDDS} goal is to build a framework
that provides services for published scientific datasets:

\begin{itemize}
   \item Data Services (\ac{OPeNDAP}, ADDE, \ac{FTP}, etc.)
   \item Data Cataloging/Inventory
   \item Data Description
   \item Data Discovery
\end{itemize}

How a system is built up of various components was demonstrated,
starting from a simple inventory.  Issues related to cataloging
and discovery were raised.  A catalog generator was demonstrated.
The need for discovery services, and several examples were given.
