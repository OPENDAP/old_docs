John Caron discussed the development of the NetCDF Markup Language
(NcML) with the Java OPeNDAP Server.  He started with a motivating
example of satellite swath wind speed data but without significant
use metadata.  Then he demonstrated how to include the appropriate
use metadata using NcML schema, and how the OPeNDAP Java Client
and/or server program would access the data, but would access
the NcML Dataset XML independently and incorporate the metadata
in the DDX.  

Conclusions:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item  An editable external representation of a dataset can be a
          non-procedural command language for manipulating it.
   \item  NcML Dataset is an enabling technology for creating
          custom views of NetCDF/OPeNDAP datasets.
\end{enumerate}
