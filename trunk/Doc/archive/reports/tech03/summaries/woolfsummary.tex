Delayed by the weather, Andrew Woolf arrived at the meeting just in
time for the closing, but he supplied a presentation on Web and Grid
Services, based on remote access to applications, based on \ac{SOAP},
\ac{WSDL}, and \ac{UDDI}.  The interaction process begins with a query
to identify and categorize the data available, and culminates with a
\ac{SOAP} request and \ac{XML} response.  This process is described in
the context of \ac{ESG}, the Global Grid Forum, and Globus.  Finally,
parallels were drawn between the Web Services design and OPeNDAP
objects.
