The DODS core software contains several sets of automated tests. To run these
test suites you must have several software development tools from the Free
Software Foundation (FSF, aka GNU). These tool are: gcc/g++, libg++,
libstdc++, make, flex, bison, gcov, dejagnu. The tool `dejagnu' is the test
driver package.

The following automated tests are part of the DODS core software: das, dds,
expression evaluator, remote server access (one test suite for each of the
following servers: netcdf, jgofs, dsp, hdf), coverage.

The das, dds and expression evaluator test suites test those parts of the
core software. The servers test suites test the core software *and* each of
the listed servers when those servers are running on a remote machine. The
coverage tests can be applied to any/all of the above test suites and
determine how much of the software was exercised by the them.

To use these tests, examine the Makefile that comes with the DODS core
software. Each test may be run by using its name as a build target to `make'.
