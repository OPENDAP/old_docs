This file contains rules for Java development. These rules are for designs
that are expressed using .java files which describe the interfaces for
objects.

1. The later stages of a design which will be implemented in Java should
include .java files which contain all the public methods of the classes in
the design.

2. Use `get'/`set' and `is' names as per the Beans spec.

3. Write javadoc comments for all public methods, constructors, fields and
constants as per `How to Write Doc Comments for Javadoc'.

4. Include as a public final String $ Id $ (Spaces added here to supress
expansion...). 

5. Include a copyright statement in every class.

6. Include a $ Log $ (spaces added...) comment in every class.

7. Should the class implement Cloneable (sic)?

8. Should some methods by synchronized?

9. Should some methods throw exceptions?

10. Check for constructors; including abstract classes.

11. Organize files as: new methods, interface implementations and method
    overrides.
