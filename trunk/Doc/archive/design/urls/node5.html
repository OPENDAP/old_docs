Characteristics of DODS and WWW URLs
</H2>

<P>
DODS URLs are a proper subset of WWW URLs. URLs defined by the WWW project
cover a wide variety of client-server systems while parts of DODS URLs are
interpreted only to be DODS CGIs. WWW URLs include special cases for servers
which support protocols such as <TT>ftp</TT>, <TT>wais</TT> and <TT>gopher</TT>. In
these cases, the <EM>Access</EM> component of a WWW URL is used to indicate
which protocol to use. When <EM>clients</EM> receive URLs, they use this
information to select which protocol should be used to access the data
referenced by the URL (i.e., the <EM>Access</EM> information is used to select
the type of server with which the client will communicate). DODS URLs are
only meaningful to CGI modules accessible over the network via HTTP servers.
Thus, there will never be any variation in the <EM>Access</EM> component of a
DODS URL. It will always be <TT>http</TT>.

<P>
In addition to a protocol restriction, DODS URLs always reference a CGI
module on the server. This is necessary because all DODS data access takes
place via one or more CGI modules. The CGI specification must follow the <EM>Host</EM> component of the URL.

<P>
While WWW URLs are the input to WWW browsers written with knowledge of URLs,
and in many cases, the ability to parse parts of URLs, DODS URLs are passed to
programs which nominally have no knowledge of URL notation. In <A NAME="tex2html18"
  HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/archive/design/data-delivery-arch/data-delivery-arch.html">DODS--Data Delivery Architecture</A> a data
system architecture is presented in which user programs are re-linked with
new implementations of data-access APIs. These <EM>client libraries</EM>
understand and can manipulate URLs (and in particular, understand the
particular restrictions DODS places on URLs) but the user programs do
not. Some of the user programs were written before any of the URL software
even existed. 

<P>
A DODS URL references a data set, or portion of a data set. Accessing a DODS
URL returns an experimental-type binary <A NAME="tex2html19"
  HREF="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/htbin/rfc/rfc1590.html">Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions</A> document. Such a document
cannot be displayed by browsers nor does it contain URLs which link the
document to other documents on the Internet. URLs that are part of the WWW
system of HTTP servers reference documents which can be displayed by a large
number of difference browsers. DODS URLs are not browsable at all, that is,
they cannot meaningfully serve as input to one of the standard WWW
browsers<A NAME="tex2html17"

HREF="footnode.html#foot577"><SUP>1</SUP></A>. DODS uses URLs
simply to reference data sets on the Internet and not for the more general
purpose of linking a document within the larger context of all documents
publicly accessible on the Internet.

<P>
There are two ways DODS CGI modules can interpret the part of the URL which
the HTTP server passes to it; as a constraint expression or as an access to a
virtual file system. This second method of interpretation is a specialization
of the general behavior of HTTPD where the text following the CGI name is
passed to the CGI module unprocessed. Accessing a data set as if it were a
virtual file system means specifying variables within the data set as if they
were files or files within directories subordinate to the CGI. For example in
Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node4.html#url:tab:examples"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="file:/usr/share/latex2html/icons/crossref.png"></A> the file name separator (<TT>/</TT>) is used to
indicate that the within the named data set (the netCDF data set called <EM>  CDT</EM>) only the variable <TT>u1</TT> is to be accessed. If the data set
contained several levels of variables, as in the examples for the three level
JGOFS data set, then a specific level or variable within a level may be
specified.  However, the virtual file system syntax is not capable of
specifying arbitrary set of variables from a data set unless those variables
happen to be the sole members of a structure of sequence (See <A NAME="tex2html20"
  HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/archive/design/api/api.html">DODS--Data Access Protocol</A> for more
information on data types DODS supports). The VFS syntax is a special case of
constraint expressions. It is included in DODS because file systems are
familiar tools to many users, much more so than boolean expressions, and
because they are flexible enough for many user's demands.

<P>
The second syntax DODS supports for the portion of the URL past the CGI name
is the constraint expression syntax. Constraint expressions are a way of
passing, along with the URL, a set of restrictions to be applied to the data
set when the client software (i.e., the surrogate library) accesses the data
set. These constraints will be used during access to the data set to limit
the variables and variable values extracted from it. The constraint
expression, or portions of the constraint expression, will be evaluated <EM>  by the server</EM> at the time of the data access. The syntax of the
expression itself is dependent on the types of variables within the data set
(See <A NAME="tex2html21"
  HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/archive/design/api/api.html">DODS--Data Access Protocol</A>).
