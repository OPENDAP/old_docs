We have developed a model of the DODS where clients communicate with one or
more servers to handle a single query. This causes no particular problems
with consistency as long as the data at those servers does not change during
the access. However, in our model, the servers may also communicate with each
other while the clients are making connections. This may introduce
consistency problems with the data held at those servers. There may be other
problems with resource locking that this causes.

Possible solution candidates are using spin locks on the servers for certain
resources or using Lamport's notion of time as periods of synchronization.

See Dec 1993/Jan 1994 ACM article on this.
