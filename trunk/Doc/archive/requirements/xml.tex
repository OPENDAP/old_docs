XML Representation of DODS Objects

Don't combine the DAS and DDS. (?)

Options:
Provide a class to do this for the client side.
Keep the objects separate on the server but send them combined.

Provide access to the XML representations using the extensions xdas, xdds and
xdods.

Develop DTDs for each of the three objects.

Use a multipart MIME document to hold data, separating binary information
from XML using the content referrer MIME header.

____________________________________________________________________________

Combine the DAS and DDS in one XML document.

Data is returned using the multipart MIME hack described above.

Access the Structure and Attrucbute information using the .xml extension.
Access the data using the .xml extension *and* supplying a constraint.

Internalize the XML-encoded information in our DAS, DDS and DataDDS objects.
