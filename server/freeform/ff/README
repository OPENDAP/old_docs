This directory contains the chapters for two distinct, but
overlapping, books.  One is the documentation for the FreeForm ND
System of Flexible Format translation, and the other is a FreeForm
application, a DODS server to serve arbitrarily-formatted data.

The two books cover much similar material, so the books share several
chapters.  If you are updating one of those chapters, please make sure
your additions are general enough to cover both cases.  Otherwise, put
them in a chapter that will only be seen by one set of users.

If you absolutely must put specific material in a chapter that will
appear in both books, you can use the following LaTeX construct to
restrict it to one or the other book:

Restrict material to the FF ND book:

\begin{ifclear}{ffs}
blah blah blah
\end{ifclear}

Restrict material to the DODS FF Server book:

\begin{ifset}{ffs}
higgle haggle huggle
\end{ifset}

(n.b. the macro \ffs stands for "DODS FreeForm Server", and is only
defined in the book covering that software.  The ifset and ifclear
environments are provided by hyperlatex.sty.)

The FF ND documentation is in ff.tex, and the DODS FF Server
documentation is in dff.tex.  Both these files should be in the parent
directory, along with a Makefile to make them.  They both use the dods
documentation package of LaTeX (see dods-book.dtx).
