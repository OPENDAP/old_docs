This document describes version \aggversion\ of the \AggServer, a
service designed to create logical groupings of individual data
files.  The individual files may be local netCDF files, or remote
files, served from an \opendap\ server.  Using the \aggser, you can
\subj{The \aggser\ creates logical groupings of \opendap\ data files.}
effectively merge these disparate files into what seems to be one
larger file, which may be sampled using the standard \opendap\
constraint expressions.  The files need not be local files, nor need
they be on the same remote server.

You can also use the \aggser\ to serve individual netCDF files.

This document assumes you are familiar with the operation of \opendap\
servers and software.  If this is not the case, you may want to
consult \DODSuser\ or \DODSquick\ first.  You will also need a basic
understanding of the syntax and construction of XML documents.
