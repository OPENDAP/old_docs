What's here

Aggregation server docs: agg.tex, agg-html/

Catalog server: catalog.tex, cat-html/

Server installation guide: install.tex, install-html/

FreeForm server and FreeForm API (from NGDC) docs:
freeform/dff.tex, dff-html

No idea, these don't seem to be used anymore:
q.tex
x.tex

Makefile: Build the code, but you need to descend into freeform and run make,
too.
