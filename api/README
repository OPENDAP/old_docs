What's here

javaDocs: Holds the HTML documentation for the Java code. These docs have a
fairly complex directory structure, so they need to be generated. If we put
them in CVS it'll not work for long because the directories move around so
much. Bummer... This is partly in CVS, but don't trust that.

pguide: The programmer's guide

wc-html, writing_client.tex: How to write a client tutorial

ws-html, writing_server.tex: How to write a server tutorial

Makefile: Should work, but you'll need to have DODS-3.4 and Java-DODS checked
out, too. You can substitute anything reasonable for DODS-3.4.

pref-html: Removed. This is a generated file; use svn to get the libdap
project, run the docs target in the Makefile. The resulting tar.gz file is
moved to the web-site project where it is in svn. The individual web pages
are not in svn anymore.
