Here are some items I know need to be done:

Make a list of all the latex documentation that is used to build HTML docs
linked into the Opendap web page. Use this list to get the set of docs that
are 'HTML docs.' The list should include the stuff that's in the 'archive'
branch of the DODS-doc module.

For all the HTML docs, check that:

    Each doc has its HTML copied into the opendap-home sub-tree in the
    correct directory. For the archive stuff, I think an opendap-home/archive
    dir will have to be made. The directory structure there should not try to
    mirror the sttucture of DODS-doc; it should just be
    opendap-home/archive/<one dir for each doc's HTML>.

    Double check that each doc gets turned into a PDF file. This means that
    we're going to have to look at the Makefiles since they are not uniform
    and some don't really woek unless you spend a fair amount of time getting
    the latex to build.

    Drop PS support.

    Make sure the PDF files are all copied to opendap-home/pdf.

    Make sure the links inside the HTML docs point to the correct location
    for the PDF files.

    Make sure all links in the HTML docs are correct. We have many reports of
    broken links in the docs. Consult the link checker output
    (www.opendap.org/links.lasest.html).

Content:

    Look at the current web pages and think about if the docs can be better
    presented there. 

    Specific docs that probably need work: I will print them and write in the
    margins. 

    Web site content: Get Peter and Dan to point to pages which need work.
    Here's my list:
