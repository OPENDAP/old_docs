PREFACE

This is a general guide to installing DODS data servers. Some servers
may have specific requirements beyond these.  Look for an
INSTALL-<server> document in this directory or in the source code
directory if you down-loaded the source code.

This is just a quick guide to installation.  The real source of
information about installing DODS servers is the official DODS server
installation manual.  This is available at the DODS web site:

             http://unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods.

ABOUT WWW SERVERS

Note: We have tested DODS servers with the NCSA and Apache http daemons
(httpd). Other servers will work as along as they support CGI 1.1 standard.
However, the installation instructions will be slightly different. Don't let
this dissuade you installing DODS servers with another httpd - the process is
very simple.

If you do not have a World Wide Web server running on the machine you want to
use as your data server machine, you can get NCSA's daemon from
http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/. The Apache daemon can be found at
http://www.apache.org/.

QUICK INSTRUCTIONS FOR SETTING UP A DATA SERVER

Unpack the distribution.  Don't forget to pick up the "server tools"
tar file as well as the specific server you plan to install.  The
tools are a bunch of files used by all the DODS servers, and are
essential to all of them.

Copy the programs in the DODS/etc directory into one of your WWW
server's CGI directories.  Put your data within the server's document
root or link it itno that directory tree somehow.  If you do this,
make sure your server is enabled to follow symbolic links.
(This is FollowSymLinks for Apache users.)

Use one of the DODS client programs to test your installation.

Consult the server installation guide with any questions that may come
up about configuring caching, compression, access control to your
data, or any troubleshooting necessary.
