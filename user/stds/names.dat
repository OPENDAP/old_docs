# A list of the acceptable DODS names.  DODS datasets using these
# names are DODS-compliant at level 1 if they also conform to the
# meta-data standards defined in chapter 2 of the stds.tex book.
#
# Please add to the list below the dashed line.  Names will be moved
# above the line if they create no important conflicts.

# The list below is a simple comma-separated list of triples,
# containing the DODS name, its decription, and the units in which it
# is to be presented.  The unit names come from the list compiled at
# Unidata for the udunits package.  See the udunits package home page
# at http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/udunits/.  As you may have
# noticed, you can use the `#' symbol to indicate comments.
