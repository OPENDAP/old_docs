\chapter{Using \opendap}
\label{opd,using}

A user uses \opendap with an \opendap client program.  This client program may
have been acquired by the user (for example, the \opendap Matlab and IDL
graphic user interfaces, or Ferret, a freeware data analysis package
each use \opendap for data access), or may be a program converted to
use the \opendap library for data access (see \chapterref{opd-client}.

In either case, there are a set of issues that must be addressed in
order to use a program to access data through \opendap.  The issues can be
classed into two groups.  One set of issues involves configuring the
system to provide \opendap with the helper applications and environment
variables it requires.  The other set concerns the manner in which a
user communicates with an \opendap server.  We cover this first.

\section{How \opendap Finds Data}
\label{opd-client,url}

\indc{URL} \indc{Uniform Resource Locator|see{URL}} Once linked to the
\opendap libraries, an \opendap client created from an existing program will
work exactly as before when run using local files.  However, a user
can also specify an \opendap Uniform Resource Locator (URL) to indicate
some data file on a remote host machine.  When the program receives
this URL, the \opendap libraries will recognize it as remote data, and
issue a network request for the data.  If a user has also installed
an \opendap server on the local machine, then local data may be accessed
either through their local filenames or their \opendap URL.

A URL is simply a unique name for some Internet resource.  
The \figureref{opd-client,fig,url-parts} shows the parts of a 
typical \opendap URL.

\caption{Parts of an \opendap URL (without a constraint expression)}
\label{opd-client,fig,url-parts}
\end{figure}

The parts of the URL are:

\begin{description}

\item[protocol] 
  \indc{Internet protocol}\indc{protocol!Internet}
  The protocol of an Internet request may be thought of as the kind
  of conversation the client expects to have with the target machine.
  For example, a web browser like Netscape Navigator wants to find
  a server that can return hypertext documents, while an ftp client
  wants to find a server that can understand file transfer requests. A
  web browser equipped to display hypertext documents will specify
  \lit{http} as the protocol for its conversation, and hope that the target
  machine has an \lit{\ind{httpd}} daemon listening.
  
\item[host] \indc{host name}The host name in a URL is simply the
  Internet address of the host machine running whatever server can
  reply to the specified protocol.
  
\item[server] A special feature of the \lit{httpd} server process is
  that it may be configured to execute Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
  programs \indc{Common Gateway Interface|see{CGI}} \indc{CGI} upon
  receipt of a properly specified URL. This is used, for example, by
  Internet search engines that ask a user to fill out a form. The CGI
  specification will be specific to the server in question, and the
  part of the URL that follows the CGI name is passed to the CGI upon
  invocation. This data may include a file name, but it may as easily
  be some arbitrary string of instructions. The \opendap server is simply
  a set of CGI scripts executed on demand by the \lit{httpd} server.
  Here, the \opendap server is represented by a CGI script called
  \lit{nph-nc}.
  
\item[filename] \indc{file name!part of URL} If a CGI is not
  specified, the part of the URL after the host name is simply the
  name of a file that is to be returned to the inquiring browser.  If
  a CGI is specified, the file is given to the program as its
  argument.

\item[URL suffix] \indc{URL!suffix} If you are issuing an \opendap request
  from a non-\opendap client, such as a web browser, you can specify the
  type of request by appending a suffix to the URL.  Different
  suffixes demand different services from the server.  The different
  services are listed in \sectionref{opd-client,services}.  If you
  are using \opendap from an \opendap client, or a client program adapted to
  use the \opendap DAP library, you do not need to use a URL suffix.  For
  example, to use \opendap from Matlab, with the Matlab GUI or
  command-line clients, you do not need to use a suffix.  To use \opendap
  from a simple web browser like Netscape Navigator, you will need to
  use a suffix.

\end{description}

The URL in \figureref{opd-client,fig,url-parts} shows a client
request to the \lit{httpd} server on the machine
\lit{dods.gso.uri.edu}, for a netCDF dataset (specified by the
\lit{nph-nc} in the \lit{cgi-bin} directory) contained in a file
called \lit{fnoc1.nc}.  Upon receiving this URL, the \lit{httpd}
server executes the specified \opendap server module (\lit{nph-nc}), which
retrieves the file is in a directory called \lit{data} relative to
wherever the \lit{httpd} server looks for its data\footnote{The only
  part of the URL whose spelling is not at the discretion of the
  administrator of the host machine is the \lit{http}, and the
  \lit{nph-} at the beginning of the CGI script name. Even the
  \lit{nc}, indicating netCDF, can be changed, although for clarity's
  sake, we hope people won't do so.  Incidentally, the \lit{nph-} is a
  relic, dating from the early days of the World Wide Web and the
  first hypertext protocol standards.  It stands for ``Non-Parsing
  Header'' (See the CGI 1.1 Standard for more information.), and is
  the only way to pass data through many httpd servers unparsed.}.

\opendap URLs can get somewhat more complicated than this simple
description.  In particular, they can contain ``constraint
expressions'' that limit a request to data satisfying a set of
conditions, and they can contain requests to specific \opendap services,
besides the data delivery service suggested here.  Constraint
expressions are described in more detail in
\sectionref{opd-client,constraint}, while the array of services
provided by \opendap servers are described in
\sectionref{opd-client,services}. 

\subsection{Security}

\indc{security!server}\indc{server!security}\indc{password!in URL}
\indc{data security}\indc{limiting access to data}\indc{access control}
\indc{username!embedding in URL}\indc{URL!embedding username in}
\indc{URL!password}
Some \opendap data providers will choose to control access to some or all
of their data.  When you request data from one of these servers, the
\opendap client  will prompt you for a username and password.  If you want
to avoid the prompt, you can make the \opendap URL even more baroque by
embedding a username and password in it, like this:

\begin{vcode}{sib}
http://user:password@www.dods.org/nph-dods/etc...
\end{vcode}


\section{The \opendap Services}
\label{opd-client,services}

\indc{services}
Up to now, we have treated the \opendap server as if it has only one
service: providing data to clients who ask for it.  It is true that
this is the most important service a server provides.  However, it is
also true that the server provides several other services besides
that.  In fact, fulfilling a request for data actually requires three
separate requests from the client, using three different services of
the \opendap server.

The services requested from an \opendap server are specified in a suffix
appended to the URL described in
\figureref{opd-client,fig,url-parts}.  Depending on the suffix
supplied, the server will provide one of these services:

%
% Changes to this list should also be reflected in the list of
% suffixes in ch04.tex.
%
\begin{description}
  
\item[Data Attribute] This service returns the entire data
  attribute structure for the given dataset. This is a text file
  describing the attributes of each data quantity in that dataset.
  (See \sectionref{data,das} for more information about data
  attributes.)  This service is activated when the
  server receives a URL ending with \lit{.das}.
  \indc{data attribute service}\indc{das@\lit{.das}}
  
\item[Data Descriptor] This service returns the entire data descriptor
  structure for the given dataset. This is a text file describing the
  structure of the variables in the dataset. (See
  \sectionref{data,dds} for more information about data descriptors.)
  This service is activated when the server receives a URL ending with
  \lit{.dds}.
  \indc{data descriptor service}\indc{dds@\lit{.dds}}
  
\item[\opendap Data] This service returns the actual data requested by
  a given URL. This is not a text file, but is encoded as a
  Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) document.  This service
  is activated when the server receives a URL ending with \lit{.dods}
  \indc{data service}\indc{dods@\lit{.dods}}
  
\item[ASCII Data] This service returns an ASCII representation of
  the requested data.  This can make the data available to a wide
  variety of browser programs.  This service is activated when the
  server receives a URL ending with \lit{.asc} or \lit{.ascii}.  
  \indc{ASCII data service}\indc{ascii@\lit{.asc}}

\item[\ifh] When the server receives a URL ending in
  \lit{.html}, it produces an HTML form containing information from
  the dataset that you can use to construct a sensible URL with which
  to request \opendap data.  The \ifh\ is also triggered when the \opendap
  server receives a URL that references a directory instead of a file.
  \indc{\ifh\ service}\indc{service!\ifh}
  \indc{html@\lit{.html}}

\item[Information]  This service returns information about
  the server and dataset, in human-readable HTML form.  The returned
  document may include information about both the data server itself
  (e.g. server functions implemented), and the dataset referenced in
  the URL.  The server administrator determines what information is
  returned in response to such a request.  This service is activated
  when the server receives a URL ending with \lit{.info}. See
  \sectionref{sec,document-data} for more information about how to
  configure the information service.
  \indc{info service}\indc{info@\lit{.info}}

\item[Version] This service returns the version information for the
  \opendap server software running on the server.  This service is
  triggered by a URL ending with \lit{.ver}.
  \indc{version service}\indc{ver@\lit{.ver}}

\item[Help] This service returns some help text in response to an
  improperly specified URL.  This service is triggered by a URL ending
  in any suffix that is not recognized by the \opendap server.
  \indc{help service}

\end{description}

\note{A request for data from an \opendap client will generally make three
different service requests, for data attributes, data descriptors, and
for data.  The prepackaged \opendap clients do this for you, so you may
not be aware that three requests are made for each URL.  That is, an \opendap client may accept an \opendap URL specifying some data, such as the
one shown in \figureref{opd-client,fig,url-parts}.  In this case, the
\opendap client library (such as nc-dods) will accept the input URL, and
append the different suffixes to that URL, making three distinct
requests to the \opendap server.}

\subsection{\ifh}

\indc{\ifh\ service}\indc{service!\ifh}
\indc{html@\lit{.html}}

Each \opendap server implements a service called the \ifh .  This is a way
to use a standard Web client, such as Netscape, to get information
about the data served by a specific server.\footnote{The \ifh\ is only
  available for servers later than version 3.1.} The \ifh\ has two
modes of operation: the directory level and the file level.

If an \opendap URL references a directory instead of a file on the server
machine, the server produces a listing similar to that shown in
\figureref{opd-client,fig,ifh-dir}.  

\figureplace{\ifh\ - Directory Level}{htbp}
{opd-client,fig,ifh-dir}{ifh-dir.ps}{ifh-dir.gif}{}

Clicking on a dataset shown in the directory-level listing 
will produce an HTML form similar to the one in
\figureref{opd-client,fig,ifh}.  The top line in the window (``Data
URL'') shows a URL that makes a request for an \opendap dataset.  The
windows below it show the variables that make up the dataset.  You can
edit the form to select the data you'd like to see from this dataset,
and the \ifh\ will edit the Data URL so that it only requests the data
you are interested in.  When done, you can push the ``ASCII'' button,
to see an ASCII representation of the data you've requested.  Netscape
cannot handle binary data, so if you
want to use the binary data, you should copy the URL in the Data URL
window to the \opendap client you'd like to use.

\section{Using an \opendap Program}
\label{opd-client,using}

\indc{troubleshooting} \indc{client!troubleshooting} There are some
configuration issues a user must consider in order to use an \opendap
client application program. There is a short list of software that is
required for some of the advanced features of \opendap, and some
environment variables that control the execution of the \opendap software.
For a piece of software that has been converted to use \opendap, after
these conditions are satisfied, the program will run in the same
manner it ran before. Aside from network delays, the user should not
be able to tell that they are accessing data from the Internet.

\indc{Internet connection!required for \opendap}
Finally, though it may seem unnecessary to mention, in order for an \opendap client application to communicate with an \opendap server, the
computer running the \opendap client must be connected to the Internet.

\subsection{Requirements}

In order to use of some of the features of the \opendap core software, a
user's computer must have some additional software installed, and
available on the user's \lit{\ind{PATH}}, in
\lit{\$DODS\_ROOT/bin} or \lit{\$DODS\_ROOT/etc}.  
\indc{client!using} \indc{required software}
\indc{necessary software} \indc{software!required} \indc{system
  configuration} \indc{configuration!system}

\begin{itemize}
  
\item The \lit{wish} {\ind{Tcl}}/{\ind{Tk}} interpreter (or whatever
  program is indicated by the \lit{DODS\_GUI} environment variable) is
  used by the {\em{\ind{GUI manager}}} to provide a progress indicator
  that displays the status of a pending data request as it is being
  processed. It is also used by the error reporting system to display
  error message received from the server.  \tbd{and by the data
    locator, to display information and query the user}
  
\item The \lit{\ind{gzip}} program, the \ind{GNU} compression
  software, is used to decompress data messages received from an \opendap
  server. If this program is not installed, the \opendap core software
  tells the server not to send compressed messages, so data may still
  be received.  However, having the compression software installed and
  available will increase the data transfer rate.

\end{itemize}

The required software, like \opendap itself, is free software. Refer to
\appref{install} for information about acquiring that software.

\subsection{Environment Variables}
\label{opd-client,environment}

After successfully relinking an application program with the \opendap
libraries, there is a short list of \ind{environment variables} that
may be defined.  Only \lit{DODS\_ROOT} is required. The other three
variables are only used to override default values controlling the GUI
manager process. Most users may safely ignore them.

\begin{description}
\item[\lit{DODS\_ROOT}]  indicates the root directory of the \opendap
  software. The \opendap core software must be able to locate utilities
  that are located in this directory tree. \indc{environment
    variables!DODS\_ROOT} \indc{variable!environment}
  
\item[\lit{DODS\_GUI}] can contain the name of the program used by the
  \new{GUI manager}.  A user might wish to change this variable to
  point to a ``safe'' Tcl/Tk interpreter; whatever program is used
  here must be able to process Tcl and Tk commands.  The default value
  is the \lit{wish} program.  \indc{DODS\_GUI} \indc{environment
    variables!DODS\_GUI}
  
\item[\lit{DODS\_GUI\_INIT}] indicates the name of any initialization
  command required by the {\em GUI manager}. The default
  initialization string executes the Tcl program in
  \lit{\$DODS\_ROOT/etc/dods\_gui.tc1}.  \indc{DODS\_GUI\_INIT}
  \indc{manager!GUI} \indc{GUI manager!initialization}
  \indc{initialization!GUI manager} \indc{environment
    variables!DODS\_GUI\_INIT}
  
\item[\lit{DODS\_USE\_GUI}] may be used to turn off the GUI manager. Set
  the value of this variable to \lit{no}, and the progress indicator
  and the error message windows will not be displayed.
  \indc{DODS\_USE\_GUI} \indc{GUI manager!turning off}
  \indc{environment variables!DODS\_USE\_GUI}

\end{description}

\note{The user has substantial control over the GUI manager. You can
  change the program that listens for GUI commands from \lit{wish} to
  anything else, and you can actually change the action of the GUI
  commands by editing the Tcl code in the files \lit{dods\_gui.tcl},
  \lit{error.tcl}, and \lit{progress.tcl}. (These are in the
  \lit{\$DODS\_ROOT/etc} directory.)  However, editing these files and
  variables will not change the form of the messages from the \opendap
  server, and from the core software that are meant to invoke these
  programs. In other words, the user may mess with these, but must be
  careful to leave the GUI manager in a form that will be able to
  process the messages it receives.}

\subsection{The Error System}

\indc{graphic user interface!error system} \indc{error system}
\indc{message!error} The GUI manager is used to display error messages
to the user. The messages themselves will vary with the server
implementation. Refer to the documentation of the particular server,
or consult the server's \lit{info} Service (See
\sectionref{opd-server,service}.), for a list of the error messages
that might be issued by a particular server.  \tbd{As error codes are
  finalized, they should be included in an Appendix of this document,
  and a pointer to them included here.}

\subsection{Temporary Files}

\indc{disk space!recovering} \indc{temporary files}
\indc{files!temporary} \indc{tmp@\lit{/tmp}}
\indc{tmpnam@\lit{tmpnam()}} Using an \opendap client application will
create a number of temporary files. They are created with the
\lit{tmpnam()} function, so their names will correspond to the rules
for that function on your system (See the manual page for
\lit{tmpnam(3)}, or type \lit{man tmpnam} for more information.)
During normal operation, \opendap will delete the temporary files it
creates as it goes. However, if execution of the \opendap client is
somehow interrupted, these files may remain, and will have to be
deleted by hand.
