Bugs.

Version incompatibilities b/w client/server.

Some URL requests do not complete (looks like a timeout)
and returns status=0 (failure) - this is consistent result. The
same URL (with a .dds filter for example) returns correctly in
a browser window.  Suspect client/server version differences.

Some versions of a server filter return incomplete DDS/data structures
for a fixed version of the IDL DODS client. As far as can be
determined, when the client and server are linked with the same
version of the core, it works.

Quite often (and to be documented), the CE option in the get_dods
call does not get used, or causes an otherwise unqualified URL to
return with status=0. If the CE value is added to the URL with a
separating "?", the request nearly always (to be documented)
works.
