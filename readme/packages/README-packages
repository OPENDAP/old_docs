Building the packages needed for the DODS core software

The best way to build the code in this directory is to use the World target
of the Makefile generated by configure. Do the following:

   ./configure
   make World |& tee World.log

uses of sh or bash do:
     
   make World 2>&1 | tee World.log

Doing the build this way ensures that the libraries are built and installed
in the correct order *and* if you encounter problems helps us fix the build
process so that it will be simpler for other users. If you do run into
problems follow the directions in `Building by hand'. Note that we have
modified some of the build procedures of the third-party software. Please
send fixes/patches to support@dods.gso.uri.edu.

Building by hand:

    NOTE: Substitute the full directory name for `packages-*' in the
    following.

zlib 1.0.4
zlib: prefix=/usr/local/DODS-2.15/packages-* ./configure
      make
      make install
      make clean

libwww 5.1d

I made the following modifications to the standard distribution:
1) I removed all the code subdirs other than Library and config.
2) I removed the generation of Makefiles in directories other than config and
Library from the configure.in file (thus configure must be remade with
autoconf). 
3) I added an `install-library-headers' target to Library/src/Makefile.in (so
it gets added to .../Makefile. This target install the headers in Library/src
and the config.h header at the top of the library distribution.
2/3/98 jhrg.

w3c-libwww: ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/DODS-2.15/packages-* \
	    --with-zlib=/usr/local/DODS-2.15/packages-*/lib/libz.a
	    make
	    make install
	    make clean

tcl 7.6: ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/DODS-2.15/packages-* --enable-gcc 
	 make
	 make install
	 make clean

TK is needed to build wish which is used by the core at runtime for the
core's GUI. 2/18/98 jhrg
tk 4.2: ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/DODS-2.15/packages-* --enable-gc \
	--with-x
	make
	make install
	make clean

I modified the Makefile.in for expect so that only the libraries and header
files are installed (and not the large executables). 2/18/98 jhrg
expect 5.2.1: ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/DODS-2.15/packages-* \
	      --enable-gcc --with-x 
	      make
	      make install
	      make clean
