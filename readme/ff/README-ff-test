These files comprise a small set of test datasets for the FreeForm server.
Each of the files named test?.fmt contains a FF format description for the
data in the data file with matching base name (test0.fmt --> test0.dat, ...).

For information on the content of these files, look in the FF manual. I've
also stuck some information in comments in the files. Note that the manual
does not contain information about the new array features of FF. The updated
FF manual *does* contain information on the array syntax. 12/15/98 jhrg

The format description files only need the *_input_data part to run with the
DODS-FF server. However, by including an ASCII_output_data section it is
simple to test the datasets and format descriptions themselves using
`newform' (which can be found in the ff-dods/FFND directory). This program
can be used to help diagnose problems with the format files.

About the dejaGNU tests:

Tests written:

Tests for the DAS and DDS (all test datasets)
Tests for the File Server software (using the 1988-6-avhrr test dataset).
      Many of the tests for error conditions fail

Tests to be written:

Tests for the compressed and uncompressed data objects w/o constraints
Tests for various types of constraints
Tests for various features of the dispatch script
