To Build the ff-dods servers:

1) Type `./configure' at the system prompt. On some systems you may have to
   type `sh configure'.

2a) Type `make' to build the three server programs

2b) Type `make check' to run the test suite. Note that on little endian
    machines (e.g., Linux running on the Intel processors) some of the data
    tests fail. These tests fail because the data files themselves are set up
    for big-endian machines (e.g., Solaris on a SPARC).

3a) To install the data server, use the new install_server shell script in the
    DODS_ROOT/etc directory or

3b) Copy the four executables (one script and three binary programs) named
    `nph-ff', `ff_das', `ff_dds' and `ff_dods' to your http server's CGI
    directory. For many UNIX computers, this will be named cgi-bin and will
    reside within the http server's home directory (e.g., on my system the
    cgi binary directory is called /usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin). You can
    find out the name of this directory if you don't know it by looking in
    the http server's srm.conf configuration file (which will be located in a
    directory called `conf' within the http server's home directory.

For information about installing secure DODS servers, see the file SECURITY
in DODS_ROOT.

NOTE FOR LINUX

Note: the new install_server script performs this task automatically; you
only need to do this if you install the server manually.

The linux shell gags on the syntax we use in the Perl scripts to locate the
perl interpreter on your system. Look at the nph-jg script. The top two lines
look like:

    #!/bin/sh -- # -*- perl -*-
    eval "exec perl -T -S $0 $*" if 0;	# Trick to find perl. Must be on PATH.

On Linux you should replace these lines with:

    #!/path/to/your/perl -T

Where /path/to/your/perl is the full pathname of the perl interpreter you
want the servers to use. You can find the path to perl on your computer by
typing:

    which perl

You can check the version of perl by typing:

    perl -v

You need Perl version 5.001 or greater.
