This directory contains the URI/GSO implementation of the DODS Data Access
Protocol. Documentation for this software can be found on the DODS home page
at http://unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/

The Data Access Protocol (DAP) is used to provide a uniform way of accessing
a variety of different types of Earth-science data within DODS.

The DAP is implemented as a set of C++ classes that can be used to build DODS
data servers and client libraries. The DAP is used to build these programs
and/or libraries by specializing the set of classes it provides so that the
specific requirements of a given API or format can be adequately addressed.

The DODS DAP is contained in a single library: libdap++.a. This library uses
some parts of the the GNU C++ class library libg++.a; it includes those parts
in its subdirectory `GNU'. You do not need to get a copy of libg++.

Test programs for the DAP are also in this directory as is a sample
specialization of the set of classes.

We also have a Java version of this class library which interoperates at the
network level with software which uses this library. In other words, client
programs built with the Java DAP implementation can communicate with servers
built with this (C++) implementation of the DAP.

See the file INSTALL in this directory for information on building the
library.
