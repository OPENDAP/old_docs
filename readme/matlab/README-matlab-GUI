INTRODUCTION:

There are two ways to get the DODS Matlab GUI: As source code and as part of
the binary release of DODS. This distinction is pretty murky for the GUI
since it consists mostly of Matlab dot-m files which are interpreted, so both
the source and binary release contain essentially the same files. We have the
two distributions because that fits well with the way the rest of DODS is
distributed.

If you have the binary distribution, then you have probably already expanded
the tar file (and thus `installed' the browser). In that case, skip the next
section and go to RUNNING THE BROWSER.

INSTALLATION (From the source-code distribution):

To unpack the Matlab GUI, go to the directory which contains your DODS root
directory, decompress and un pack the tar file. In the following, $DODS_ROOT
will be used wherever we mean the root directory of DODS on your system.

     mv DODS-matlab-gui-<version>.tar.gz ${DODS_ROOT}/..
     gzip -d -c DODS-matlab-gui-<version>.tar.gz | tar -xvf -

     Notes: 1) ${DODS_ROOT}/.. is the directory which contains $DODS_ROOT
	    2) If you don't have gzip on your computer, you can get a copy
	    from our ftp archive or from the Gnu software archive at 
	    prep.ai.mit.edu.

This will create the directory $DODS_ROOT/src/matlab-GUI. In that directory
you'll find the complete source files for the GUI.

Change directory to $DODS_ROOT/src/matlab-GUI, run `configure' and `make
install'. These steps will perform minimal customization of the browser to
your machine and copy the files into your $DODS_ROOT/bin directory. Because
the browser contains several files, the installation process creates a
directory in $DODS_ROOT/bin (called matlab-gui) for these files. 

RUNNING THE BROWSER:

Note: In order to use the Matlab GUI, you'll need two support programs:
loaddods and writeval. When you get the binary distribution of the Matlab
GUI, these are included automatically. If you got the source distribution you
must also get the `Matlab client' distribution (which contains both loaddods
and writeval. Also worth noting is that these support programs can be used in
your own Matlab scripts to retrieve data via DODS.

In order to run the browser you should do two things so that Matlab can find
various support software. First, define a shell environment variable named
DODS_ROOT setting its value to the fully qualified path to the root of your
copy of the DODS software. For example, suppose that the $DODS_ROOT directory
is /usr/local/DODS-2.14c, then you'd add 

	  setenv DODS_ROOT /usr/local/DODS-2.14c

to your .cshrc (if you're using csh, or tcsh) or

	  DODS_ROOT=/usr/local/DODS-2.14c
	  export DODS_ROOT

to your .profile (if you're using sh, ksh or bash).

The second thing you need to do is add $DODS_ROOT/bin to your matlabpath. You
can do this in Matlab once you have it running or in your Matlab startup file
using the command:

          addpath /usr/local/DODS-2.14c/bin

Now change directory to the Matlab-GUI directory, run Matlab and type
`browse' at the Matlab prompt.

As an alternative, you can add $DODS_ROOT/bin/Matlab-GUI to you matlabpath
and run the browser from any directory. E.G.:

	  addpath /usr/local/DODS-2.14c/bin/Matlab-GUI

PROBLEMS USING THE BROWSER:

If you have a problem using the browser, check this FAQ to see if there is a
solution to your problem here. If not send a message describing the problem
to support@dods.gso.uri.edu. If you can, please include a copy of the any
error messages printed by the software along with information so that we can
repeat the problem. The latter helps immeasurably.

PROBLEM: The browser complains about about not finding `loaddods'.

FIX: Make sure that $DODS_ROOT/bin is on your matlabpath. See RUNNING THE
BROWSER above.

PROBLEM: The browser complains that is cannot find `writeval'

FIX: Make user that your DODS_ROOT environment variable points towards the
correct directory (and for Bourne Shell users, that it is exported). See
RUNNING THE BROWSER above. 

PROBLEM: The dataset I want to use has disappeared from the dataset list!

FIX: 1: This means you have selected a time, depth or geographic range 
that is 'out of range' for that dataset.  To be sure you are not eliminating
datasets you might like to see, push the 'clear selections' button at the
bottom of the browse window.  Now select the desired dataset, and the depth
and geographic ranges will be set to those of the dataset.  Zoom in on the 
time axis to select an appropriate time period within the dataset range, or 
flip to 'view text' and type in an appropriate time range (use decimal years).

2:  To view the ranges for a variety of datasets, simply click 'reset list'
at the bottom of the dataset menu.  Each dataset may then be selected in
turn, and the ranges for that set will appear on the browse window.  Once
you have found a dataset you would actually like to use, click on the
'clear selections' button (to clear selected ranges) and then re-select 
the desired dataset.  Your depth and geographic selection ranges will 
automatically be set to those of the dataset.  Zoom in on the time axis
to select an appropriate time period within the dataset range, or flip
to 'view text' and type in an appropriate time range (use decimal years).

PROBLEM:  I've selected a dataset.  I click on 'get data' or 'get details'
and nothing happens!

FIX:  Look for messages in the main workspace.  Most likely, one or more
of your selection ranges is not set, or possibly they are all set but are
not within the valid ranges for that dataset.  In the former case, the
browser will send a message prompting you to set all the ranges.  In the
latter case, it will send a message that the dataset is out of range, and
'de-select it'.

PROBLEM: Plotting the dataset results in a box with some vertical
lines running up through the middle of the range box.

FIX:  This is because the dataset range given in the metadata is less than 
the full 360 degrees.  For example, a range of [0 359.5].  When this is 
displayed in longitude coordinates of [-180 180], vertical lines at -0.5 
and 0 will result -- the browser has no way to determine if this gap is 
'real' (a gap in the dataset > dx), or just a side effect of wraparound.
We encourage data providers to list truly global datasets as having a 360 
degree longitude range, and to write the supplementary software to handle
such requests.

PROBLEMS DUE TO KNOWN MATLAB BUGS 06/06/1997

BUGS IN MATLAB V4:

PROBLEM: An error when starting the browser that looks like this:

        ???          OKCallback
                     |
         Undefined function or improper matrix reference.


FIX: It appears some distributions of Matlab v4 do not contain the script
'inputdlg.m'.  You are missing that function.  We have included it in this 
distribution, as 'inputdlg.tpl' (renamed to avoid conflict with systems that
DO have the script).  Simply copy the provided script (inputdlg.tpl) to 
inputdlg.m (you can leave it right in the browser directory), quit Matlab, 
and start again.

PROBLEM: Zooming in on a displayed image causes it to disappear.

FIX: This is a fundamental bug in the 'image' command of Matlab v4.  The 
Mathworks has no plans to patch it now that v5 has been released.  The
only fixes are: Fix 1) plot each dataset separately in its own window, and 
then setting 'zoom on' in these windows.  In which case you may encounter 
the following instability in Matlab v4.

Image color indexing error in InterpolateImageWarped
Image color indexing error in InterpolateImageWarped
Image color indexing error in InterpolateImageWarped
Image color indexing error in InterpolateImageWarped

repeatedly scrolling up the screen.  Hit Control-C to stop!

Fix 2) use the 'pcolor' command instead of 'image'. Fix 3) update to Matlab v5.

PROBLEM: Zooming in on an image causes the image pixels to be located in the
wrong place or to appear larger than actual (bleeding effect).

FIX: This is an unavoidable side-effect of the 'image' command. Use pcolor
instead.

BUG IN MATLAB V5:

PROBLEM: Repeated 'error' messages (it's not actually an error) of the nature:
  Warning: Future versions will return empty for empty == scalar comparisons
  In dispmenu.m at line 23
  In dispmenu.m at line 458
  In browse.m at line 997
  In browse.m at line 975
or
  Warning: One or more output arguments not assigned during call to 'browse'.
etc.

FIX: There are no real problems here.  If you find the messages annoying, type 
'warning off' at the Matlab prompt.

PROBLEM: The slider bar on the dataset and variables menus (only visible when > 20
items on the list) 'jumps', not scrolling the list smoothly.

FIX: This is a bug in the Unix/Linux release of Matlab v5.  They have promised
a patch.  Contact tech-support@mathworks.com or (508) 653-1415 to find out
if a patch is available yet.

PROBLEM: Zooming in causes vertical lines (for example, the vertical parts of
dataset range boxes or the selection range boxes) to disappear.

FIX:  This is a bug in the Linux release of Matlab v5.  The Mathworks has 
been notified.  Contact tech-support@mathworks.com or (508) 653-1415 to find 
out if a patch is available yet.

PROBLEM: Zooming in on an image causes the image pixels to be located in the
wrong place or to appear larger than actual (bleeding effect).

FIX: This is an unavoidable side-effect of the 'image' command. Use pcolor
instead.
