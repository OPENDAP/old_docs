  MEXCDF is a mex-file interface between netCDF and MATLAB 
  that invokes the complete C-Language netCDF interface,
  as described in the NetCDF Users Guide.   This allows MATLAB 
  users to read, write, and manipulate netCDF data files in an
  efficient manner.

  What you should do:

1. Get the binary mexcdf mex-file.  

   If you have any of the following platforms running Matlab 4.0 or
   above, you should be able to grab the appropriate file:

   /pub/mexcdf/bin:
      ms-win31.mex       PC  MS-Windows
      mexcdf.mex.hqx   Mac (BinHexed) 
      sgi_irix_4.tar.Z     SGI compiled with IRIX 4.0.5
      sgi_irix_5.tar.Z     SGI compiled with IRIX 5.2
      dec_osf_2.tar.Z      DEC AXP compiled with OSF1/v2.1
      dec_ultrix_4.tar.Z   DECstation compiled with Ultrix 4.3
      sun_sunos_4.tar.Z    SUN compiled with SunOS 4.1.3
      sun_solaris_2.tar.Z  SUN compiled with Solaris 2

   Use binary mode when you get these files, EXCEPT for 
   .hqx files, which should be transfered as ASCII.  mexcdf.sit.hqx
   should be un-binhexed using binhex4.0 or higher and then unstuffed
   using un-stuffit. Compressed tar (.tar.Z) files can be expanded by
   typing "zcat dec_osf_2.tar.Z | tar xvf -".  The reason I tarred and
   compressed the executables was to hopefully keep people from renaming
   the mex-file binaries.
   
   NOTE: DON'T rename the mexcdf binary.  MATLAB expects MEX files to have
   platform-specific file extentions (mex4 on Sun4, mexds on DECstation, etc.)

   Also get mexcdf.m, which describes the usage of mexcdf and 
   will allow you to use "help mexcdf" from within matlab.  

   If you need to compile the source code for mexcdf, grab
   the files in /pub/mexcdf/src.  Note that mexcdf.c must 
   be compiled with an ANSI C compiler (e.g. gcc).

2. Get the usage of mexcdf by typing "mexcdf" in Matlab, or check
   out the file mexcdf.m.  

3. Optional.  mget everything in the /pub/mexcdf/tools directory 
   (all the m-files and flux.dat) and check out
   some applications that use mexcdf.

   Note to DOS-Users: 
   Some of the m-files have file names that are longer than 8 characters, 
   and may have to be modified to work on the PC.

   The function getcdf.m is an interactive routine written by Jim Mansbridge
   that leads you through the extraction of data from netCDF files.

   The function mcvgt.m is a noninteractive routine that returns netCDF data
   when you already know the name of the variable you want and the
   indices of the data slab you wish to return.

   The function make_ts.m creates a netCDF time series file using file using 
   NOAA PMEL's EPIC conventions.  This allows the created file to
   be interfaced directly to Don Denbo's PlotPlus program.

   The function getts.m gets time series data from netCDF files using 
   EPIC conventions (e.g. files written by create_ts.m).  The user specifies 
   the variable and the start and stop time and is returned the data
   variable and a Julian time variable.

   The script cdf_demo.m demonstrates the use of make_ts.m and getts.m by 
   creating a netcdf time series file of heat flux from Matlab, then 
   reading selected data back into Matlab.

   The functions read_gmt.m and write_gmt.m reads GMT style netCDF grid 
   files (GMT is Paul Wessel and Walter Smith's freely available plotting and 
   analysis package).

History of mexcdf: Chuck Denham (cdenham@nobska.er.usgs.gov) 
  wrote the first netCDF/Matlab interface using m-files
  that called stand-alone C-programs to implement the interface.  For each
  netCDF operation, netCDF files were opened and closed, and netCDF data
  were written to matlab .mat files which were then "loaded" into Matlab.  
  The result was useful, but inefficient.   To increase the efficiency, 
  Jim Mansbridge of CSIRO (mansbrid@flood.ml.csiro.au) combined many operations
  into a single FORTRAN mex-file, called xnetcdf.f.  Realizing the utility
  of this method, Julie Allen of WHOI (jallen@whoi.edu) rewrote xnetcdf.f
  in C, implemented additional operations (including operations relating to
  creation of netCDF files from Matlab), and named the mexfile mexcdf.c.
  The mexcdf.c code was rewritten by Chuck Denham to allow more flexibility
  in the way the netCDF operations are invoked, and to streamline the code
  to work on Macintosh and IBM PCs.
