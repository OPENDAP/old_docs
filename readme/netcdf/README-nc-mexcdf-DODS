I have modified the src and tools directories for DODS. In the src directory
I have added a Makefile.in and Makefile for DODS. This re-links the mexcdf
object module with the DODS-netCDF software so that all of the functions in
the mexcdf file can access DODS data servers. The Makefile is generated
automatically when the configure script is run; the new version of mexcdf is
built whenever you run `make' in the netCDF main directory.

In the tools directory I modified some of the code so that it would accept
URL where previously only local filenames would work. The new functions are
named dinqcdf, dgetcdf and dgetcdf_batch. Except for the additional
capabilities of DODS the functions are unchanged; they can still read local
data just like the original versions (which are included in the tools
directory as well).
