Notes: 

1) The rest of this document notwithstanding, make sure to copy the *.css
files to <web site>/resources and the *.hlx files to <hyperlatex lib>.

2) The 'ins' files are used to generate the stuff (sty, hlx, css, cls, ...)
   files from the dtx file. Use 'latex <base>.ins' to generate. Use 'latex
   <base>.dtx' to build documentation for the cls, et cetera.

3) The Makefile mostly works.

4) Use either the dods-paper or dods-book class, don't use dods-book2.

5) If you're getting errors like "" Try this:

      If all of these are correct and TeX still complains about not being
      able to store the files it is possible that the file texmf.cnf
      prohibits writing into the system trees. Look for the line with
      openout_any; if it's value is 'p' (paranoid) change it to 'r'
      (restricted).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

These LaTeX 2.09 style files are used by DODS but do not come with the
standard distribution of LaTeX.

margins.sty: Written at URI. Makes 1 inch margins (more or less).

html.sty: Part of LaTeX2HTML. Special support for the LaTeX2HTML translator.

code.sty: From CTAN. For Source code.  Don't use.  Use vcode.sty instead.

psfig.sty: From CTAN. For including postscript figures. Works well with
	   LaTeX2HTML. 


These style files were written to support the DODS documentation:


dods-book.dtx -- DODS documentation tools, with accompanying usage
     instructions, including a small number of style issues.  These
     are meant to work as a LaTeX class, and to produce html with the
     Hyperlatex package.
     
dods-book.ins -- unpacking instructions for the DODS doc tools,
     including vcode.sty and marginparpatch.sty.

dods-book2 -- *Use dods-book instead 07/02/04 jhrg* There is a dods-book2
     class, essentially the same as dods-book, but produces slightly livelier
     HTML documentation. Use this for informal short guides.

dods-paper -- This class is for short DODS papers.  If dods-book is a
     substitute for the LaTeX book class, this is a substitute for the
     article class.

proto.sty -- This is a package meant to work with the doc++ package.
     It replaces the doc++.sty that comes with that package, and fixes
     some formatting problems with that file.  DODS uses a slightly
     hacked version of the doc++ package (does a nicer job with the
     prototype displays, compiles with gcc 2.8.1, creates a chapter
     instead of a free-standing document, other fixes).  We don't use
     doc++ any more, so you can safely ignore this. 

vcode.dtx -- Creates verbatim output, but with better formatting
     control (indentation, vertical alignment, font size, box around
     the output) There is also a vcode.ins to unpack this package.

mparhack.dtx -- Partially fixes a LaTeX bug for marginpars.  (That is,
     it is a complete fix, but only for single-column documents.)
     There is also a mparhack.ins for unpacking.



HYPERLATEX

Some instructions for hyperlatex.

First, the hyperlatex class files must be generated from the dods
source.  Try `make all', which should generate the hlx files (as well
as the cls files you'll need to use regular LaTeX on the dods
documents). 

To make hyperlatex run, you must copy the .hlx files in this directory
to the place where hyperlatex expects to find them.  Unfortunately,
this is not consistent.  If you install hyperlatex from the hyperlatex
distribution, the hlx file directory will probably be

  /usr/local/lib/hyperlatex.  

If you're getting this from a Debian distribution, look in

  /usr/lib/hyperlatex.   

There is a Makefile in this directory, and `make install' should
deliver all the necessary hyperlatex files to the right directory, if
you find the directory and edit the Makefile first.

To reiterate, try this:

  1. Find the hyperlatex directory.
  2. Make sure that the Makefile here points to it.
  3. `make all'
  4. `make install'
