%> Subject: Including code within a verbatim environment

%> Is there any way to read a file within a verbatim environment? One would
%> like to place a code fragment or a subroutine in a document something like
%> the following

%> \begin{verbatim}
%> \input code.c
%> \end{verbatim}

%> Obviously, this won't work because "\input code.c" will be typeset as it
%> is. I don't want to put the \begin{verbatim}-\end{verbatim} in the actual
%> file code.c because it is a working piece of code.

%> Any suggestions?

%A few years ago, I created a style file, listing.sty, to provide such a =

%facility.

%Typical usage:

%\documentstyle[listing]{report}

%\begin{document}

%\listing{code.c} % plain listing
%\nlisting{more-code.c} % listing with line numbers

%\end{document}

%Here is the style file (listing.sty):
