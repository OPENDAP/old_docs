Development of several specific elements are underway currently, and
they will have a major impact on the way the OPeNDAP system develops
and will be used in the future by various user communities.
Three of these elements were culled out for specific discussion:
the new \ac{DAP} Specification and its attendant document, the
connection between \ac{SIS} and \ac{GIS}, and the \ac{AIS}.  

Also of primary importance for the \ac{NVODS} effort is the
treatment of in-situ data.  The development of tools that allow
users to discover and get detailed listings of data of interest
to them so they can select the specific data they want to access
is of primary importance in capturing new users for 
\ac{OPeNDAP}.  Finally, several
user groups presented work not specifically related to the above
special topics.

Five breakout discussions were held in two sessions.  The
breakout topics were:

\begin{enumerate}
   \item The \ac{DAP} Specification,
   \item The \ac{AIS},
   \item In-situ data and their aggregation,
   \item Discovery and Inventory tools, and
   \item The \ac{SIS} - \ac{GIS} Connection.
\end{enumerate}

The results of these breakouts are given in separate sections
in this report.
