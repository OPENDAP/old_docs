The \ac{OPeNDAP} \ac{DAP} is used extensively for moving oceanographic
and atmospheric data.  One of the surprises in its use is that it is
used intensively \italic{internally} to move data, particularly modeling
data, within organizations such as \ac{COLA} and projects such 
as \ac{GODAE}.  Some organizations have invested
large resources to make systems that allow them specific access to
their data, and they use and adapt the \ac{DAP} to their needs.

Two topics that permeated the conference but which were not discussed
as conference topics, and which are candidates for discussion in the
future are

\begin{enumerate}
   \item Metrics, and
   \item the open-source nature of \ac{OPeNDAP}, particularly the contribution
of significant software by outside developer/users, and how best to
entrain them into the system in a way which is compatible with the
\ac{DAP} and conducive to the enhancement of the system.
