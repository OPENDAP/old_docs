The goal of the meeting was three-fold:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Discuss Specific Open Issues: Identify and discuss current needs 
      and developments related to specific issues within the \ac{OPeNDAP} Project.

\item Community Cohesion: Bring developers together from all sectors
      of the project to allow them to see what is going on throughout the
      project and give them a feeling of where they fit within the
      larger picture.

\item Fermentation and exchange of ideas:  Bring the developers and
      users together to give them an opportunity for free discussion
      of the \ac{OPeNDAP}, its directions, current and future  developments.
\end{enumerate}
