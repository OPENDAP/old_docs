Conclusion:  The group concluded that web search engines are a viable
  facility to discover OPeNDAP-accessible resources on the internet,
  and that existing services and any new services developed to
  facilitate data discovery should generate persistant HTML representations
  that web search engines can harvest.   To roll-out this capability
  the group suggested developing a very simple server identification
  service as an initial test, and that 'Best Practices' documents and
  tools should be developed to assist Data Providers.
