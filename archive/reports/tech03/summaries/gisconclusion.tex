The general problem of connecting \ac{GIS} to \ac{SIS} is still
without solution.  The breakout discussed several possibilities
that are of specific interest to the breakout participants.
Here is a short list of the resulting plans:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed tools:  

     \begin{itemize}
        \item \ac{NODC} will develop an ArcIMS \ac{OPeNDAP} Connector,
        \item \ac{OPeNDAP} to \ac{GeoTIFF} Server: \ac{NODC},
Unidata, PMEL.
        \item ArcIMS, \ac{OGC} \ac{WMS} back end for \ac{LAS}: \ac{PMEL},
Roland and John (Cartwright?) will merge \ac{GeoTIFF}/\ac{WCS} efforts
for next generation of \ac{GeoTIFF} production.
      \end{itemize}

    \item \ac{UCAR} and \ac{ESRI} Users' Conference:  John Caron
(Unidata) is working with Steve Kopp (\ac{ESRI} to get science data
into ArcGLOBE in time for a demo at the Conference.

        \item Datasets to be served as ArcIMS backgrounds/GeoTIFFs:
\ac{NGDC} Coastal Bathymetry \ac{NESDIS} Satellite Products, \ac{NODC}
Satellite Products.

        \item  In order to insure that vector and point equivalant data in
\ac{OPeNDAP} can be converted into \ac{GeoTIFF}s, some in-situ standards
may be helpful.
\end{itemize}
