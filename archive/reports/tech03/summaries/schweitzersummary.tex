Roland Schweitzer summarized the status of Data served into OPeNDAP
at NOAA/CDC.  Almost 7 gigabytes are served.  The data are accessable
via FTP, OPeNDAP via a NetCDF server, a Unidata Aggregation server,
and the GrADS DODS Server. The GDS configuration will be updated
automatically for regularly updated datasets.  The THREDDS catalog 
will allow access to all services.  

Questions:  Can the servers
handle the loads, will naive use cripple the servers, and will
services be robust?  Partial solutions include blocking a single
IP address for 24 hours which has more than 1000 hits in a single
hour, and blocking access if a load exceeds some threshold.  The
result is that the system provides feedback to the user who is
motivated to become self-correcting.
