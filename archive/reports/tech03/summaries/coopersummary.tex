Larry Cooper sent a report on the plan and progress in the Southern
California Coastal Water Research Project NVODS Pilot Project
using OPeNDAP.  The plan is to implement OPeNDAP servers to
target 4 large sanitation districts, and to adapt the client
of choice used by those four districts to access OPeNDAP
available data.  The data used for development are CTD data 
from two regional monitoring projects.  They will use a PostGRES
DBMS because it supports views.  They will adopt the Interactive
Geographic Ocean Data System (IGODS) Client because it is the
client of choice among the users of the data.  The status is that
the Database is up and running, Tom Cat is up and running, they
can access the database through a browser, the client evaluation
is complete and they have started adapting IGODS to OPeNDAP.
