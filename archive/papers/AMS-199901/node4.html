      Using DODS to Access and Deliver Remote Data

    <h1>4. How To Use DODS</h1>

    <p>
      DODS is based upon the same technologies that have made the Web
      so successful.  DODS data servers use standard web server
      technology. The communication protocol is the same as when you
      access a document with your web browser.  Similar to other web
      documents, DODS data is requested with a URL.  This means that,
      basically, your DODS-enabled application becomes a specialized
      web browser.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you have a URL for the data you want, you can use your
      DODS-enabled application to access the data by specifying the
      URL as you would normally specify the file name.
