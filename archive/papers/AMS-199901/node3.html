      Using DODS to Access and Deliver Remote Data
    </h1>
    <h1>3. How To Get DODS</h1>

    <p>
      The DODS software is freely available and can be obtained
      through the DODS web site,
      http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/.  As described above,
      DODS is made up of both clients and servers.  To make your data
      available to others, you will need to download the DODS server
      software appropriate for your data.  If you wish to access DODS
      data, you only need download the DODS client software
      appropriate for your data analysis tool.  Currently, the Matlab
      and IDL applications are available pre-linked to DODS.  Also,
      any analysis package which is based on standard netCDF may be
      easily DODS-enabled by simply relinking the package with the
      DODS-netCDF libraries.  Ferret, a public domain analysis package
      developed at the Pacific Marine Environment Laboratory (PMEL) of
      NOAA (http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/Ferret/), is an example of such
      a package that has been thoroughly tested with DODS.  The Matlab
      and IDL applications as well as the Matlab GUI can be accessed
      from the DODS web page with the "GUI Software" link in the table
      of contents.
    </p>

    <p>
      DODS software is available as binaries for many of the popular
      Unix systems (see the URL below for the current list of
      supported systems).  If you are using one of the supported
      systems, downloading the binaries is the easiest way to get
      started using DODS.  To obtain the binary software, just go to
      this URL:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/home/binary.shtml">
        http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/home/binary.shtml</a>
    </ul>

    <p>
      and select the software you need.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a binary release is not available for your computer and you
      are using a UNIX operating system, you can acquire and build
      DODS using the source distribution.  For the source
      distribution, go to this URL:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/home/source.shtml">
        http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/home/source.shtml</a>
    </ul>

    <p>
      and select the core software and the client and/or server
      software appropriate for your needs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Documentation on how to install the software is included with
      the downloaded software.  The web documentation also gives
      details on the installation process.
