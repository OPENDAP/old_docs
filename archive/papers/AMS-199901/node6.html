      Using DODS to Access and Deliver Remote Data

    <h1>6. Collaborators</h1>

    <p>
      The initial design and implementation of DODS was undertaken as
      part of a collaboration between the University of Rhode Island
      and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Since then those
      actively participating in DODS has grown to include systems
      developers and scientists from URI, MIT, JPL/PO-DAAC, NOAA/PMEL,
      NCAR/HAO, UCAR/Unidata, AGU, GSFC/GCMD, OSU, U. Miami, Scripps,
      and U. Hawaii.
