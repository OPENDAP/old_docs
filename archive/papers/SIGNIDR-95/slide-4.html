<h3>
<em>Previously:</em>
</h3>

<ul>   
       <li> Local data only
       <li> Minimal sharing of data
       <li> Researcher was intimately familiar with the data and its
       structure
       <li> Data was <em>formatted</em> specially for the researcher's
       data analysis applications
       <li> Researcher's <em>data system</em> was customized to provide
       efficiency or flexibility for specific types of data
</ul>

<h3>
<em>Now:</em>
</h3>

<ul>
    <li> Both remote and local data
    <li> Shared data comes from many other scientists and centralized archives
    <li> Global (<em>community resource</em>) datasets are being generated for
    wide distribution
    <li> Data exists in many different structures which are dependent on
    source and content
    <li> Researchers continue to use their own scientific applications for
    analyzing data
</ul>
