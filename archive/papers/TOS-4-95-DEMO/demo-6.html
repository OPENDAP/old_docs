<h1>
DODS Client libraries:
</h1>

<h3>
<ul>
	<li>Can be used by many programs - The time spent modifying the
	original library is justified by the large number of user programs
	which can benefit from the new library <p>

	<li>Facilitate the modification of legacy software <p>
	
	<li>Simplify the development of new network-aware software <p>

	<li>Enable analysis packages to read data stored in many formats <p>

</ul>
</h3>

<em>Because DODS client libraries communicate with DODS servers using a
single language, they can read data which is stored in many different
formats.</em>
