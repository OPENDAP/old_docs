<h1>
The Distributed Oceanographic Data System:
</h1>

<h3>
<ul>
	<li>Not a system in the traditional sense<p>

	<li><em>Components</em> that provide direct access to oceanographic
	data over the Internet<p>

	<li>Driven by science requirements<p>

	<li>Data maybe stored at many sites ranging from traditional
	archives to sites with recently gathered data<p>

	<li>Data may be stored in many different formats<p>
</ul> 
</h3>

<h3>
<em>A workshop held in the Fall of 1993 defined the requirements, and
suggested several design paths, for DODS. The workshop participants consisted
of a mix of oceanographers, data archives maintainers and software
developers.</em>
