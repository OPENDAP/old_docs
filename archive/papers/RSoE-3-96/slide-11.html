<h1>
The client-server interface
</h1>

<p>

<h3>
<em>
The interface between the client program and the data server must be
available to the user.
</em>
<ul>
	<li>These interfaces must support operations beyond those
	for the client program's built-in data types
	<li>Users must be able to control the translation from general
	representations to their application's specific representations
	<li>Users must not be <em>expected</em> to write software, but the
	system should not exclude that option
</ul>
</h3> 

<br><br><br>

<h3><em> 
Because distributed systems must move data using a common format (or small
set of common formats) it is important to put the user in the data
translation loop. In addition, users must be able to control how data is
constrained on the server-side without being limited to only those data types
that can be represented by the client-side.
</em></h3>
