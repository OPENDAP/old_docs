<h1>
Client-side characteristics
</h1>

<p>

<h3>
<em>
Three characteristics drive the requirements for client applications:
</em>
<ul>
	<li>Use of existing software
	<li>Division of operations between client and server
	<li>User access to the client/server interface
</ul>
</h3> 

<br><br><br><br><br>

<h3><em> 
Distributed systems are little more than `big disks' unless they separate
processing tasks among the various client and server components of the
system. However, this means that some operations previously associated with
the client (i.e., analysis application) should be moved to the server.
