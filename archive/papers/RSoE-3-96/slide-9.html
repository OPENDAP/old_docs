<h1>
Existing software
</h1>

<p>

<h3>
<em>
There are several different types of existing software:
</em>
<ul>
	<li>Analysis programs already written
	<li>Data access APIs already designed and implemented
	<li>Common, well understood, development models
</ul>
</h3> 

<br><br><br><br>

<h3><em> 

While using existing analysis programs is important, it only scratches the
surface of the spectrum of `existing software'. Data access APIs and the
extant body of programming paradigms is a much more important resource. APIs
are important because they are designed with longevity in mind; accommodating
them increases the stability of a system. Designing a system which CO-opts
existing software paradigms incorporates into the system a large body of
design expertise and makes it easier for people to use.
