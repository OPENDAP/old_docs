Title: The Distributed Oceanographic Data System: Requirements for Data
Analysis Applications

Authors: James Gallagher and Peter Cornillon

Abstract: Access to distributed remote data alters both the scientist's use
of data and expectations of analysis software. Access to remote data is
fundamentally different from access to local data because the potential pool
of resources is vastly larger. When confronted with this largesse, users
requirements for data analysis software changes. Because users do not control
remote data resources, they need ways to search among all available data sets
for a particular type of information. These searches are different than the
traditional database search because users, not knowing precisely what data
exists, conduct their search in an iterative manner, asking repeatedly more
specific questions. Users also want to select data from a data set in ways
that suite their own work; this often means that remotely accessible data
sets must support a more general query mechanism than those accessible only
locally. Finally, users expect to be able to operate on several remote data
sets at once, combining these different data in a single display. Within The
Distributed Oceanographic Data System, we have had unique experience with the
new requirements scientists place on data analysis applications because DODS
provides a pathway for existing analysis programs to be extended so that they
can access remote data resources.
