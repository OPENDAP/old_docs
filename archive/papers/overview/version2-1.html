<em>New features in version 2 provide users with more control of the data
returned by a server and better feedback while the transfer is taking place.
The error system was designed to provide users with important information in
a way that would work well with existing software. Improving our use of the
MIME and http standards positions the system to better take advantage of new
developments in the network community.</em>
