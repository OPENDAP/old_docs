<br><br><br><br><br>

<em>Basic access to remote data sets is implemented in version 1 of DODS
using URLs to reference remote data. Data is read from remote
servers by the DODS core software by reimplemented versions of selected data
access APIs. The data servers are far simpler to install then conventional
daemons because they leverage off of the widespread httpd from NCSA (other
http daemons will work as well). Using network-wide standards like http make
integration of third-party browsers a simpler task with behavior users are
more likely to understand.</em>
