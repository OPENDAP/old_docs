<h1>
Future development efforts at URI/MIT:
</h1>

<h3>
<ul>
	<li>Complete Version 2 of the core software (late Dec. 1995).
	<ul>
		<li>Add Constraint expression evaluation.
		<li>Add formal translation mechanism.
	</ul><p>

	<li>Integrate Version 2 core software with NetCDF and JGOFS data
	servers and client-libraries (March 1996).<p>

	<li>Improve documentation quality (Incrementally with complete
	Version 2 User and developer documents by late March 1996 - interim
	documents available sooner).<p>
</ul> 
</h3>

<h3>
<em>
Version 2 of DODS will include two new important features: Constraint
expressions and a formal mechanism for datatype translation. These two
features will enable users to tailor server responses to their needs and
simplify construction of client-libraries which perform sophisticated
translations transparently to the user.
