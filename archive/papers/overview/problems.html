<h1>
Known weaknesses of DODS:
</h1>

<ul>
	<li><font size = "+1">In many cases the data types defined by the DAP
	do not provide the flexibility needed by some APIs (e.g., DODS lacks
	intra dataset pointers).</font><p>

	<li><font size = "+1">The current model of translation may not prove
	powerful enough as new APIs are added to the system.</font><p>

	<li><font size = "+1">The servers do not support the data locator
	well. Without better support it is hard to imagine the locator living
	up to its potential.</font><p>
</ul>
