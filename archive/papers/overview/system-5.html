Client programs are built using existing software.

<h3>
<ul>
	<li>A program which uses a <em>supported</em> API to read local data
	can be rebuilt to read data from DODS servers. <p>

	<li>The source code which implements the API is modified, not the
	user program - Most user programs can be rebuilt with no
	re-programming. <p>

	<li>Linking analysis programs with DODS libraries means that
	users can use existing analysis packages/procedures (including those 
	they have developed in-house) rather than picking from a handful of 
	client programs developed specifically for DODS. <p>
</ul>
