HyperText Transfer Protocol--HTTP</A>
</H2>

<P>
A second data delivery mechanism that is, on the surface, very different from
RPCs is the <A NAME="tex2html16"
  HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/HTTP2.html">HyperText Transfer Protocol</A><A NAME="tex2html14"

HREF="footnode.html#foot460"><SUP>3</SUP></A>. This transport mechanism is primarily intended to move
hypertext documents (text, images, ...) over a network. Its basic unit of
transfer is a file. The protocol is closely coupled with existing HTTP
servers from <A NAME="tex2html17"
  HREF="http://www.w3.org/">World Widw Web Consortium</A>, <A NAME="tex2html18"
  HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">National Center for Supercomputing Applications</A> and commercial providers.  These servers support
an extension mechanism called the <A NAME="tex2html19"
  HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/overview.html">Common Gateway Interface</A> which can be used to transform
information on the server computer to a hypertext document. Once the
hypertext document has been prepared, it is passed back to the HTTP server
which then sends it to the client.

<P>
A crucial difference between RPC technology and HTTP is that RPC is used to
build an application-level communication protocol while HTTP <EM>is</EM> an
application level protocol. While RPC can be used to build either stateless
of stateful distributed systems, HTTP can only be used to build stateless
systems. Because HTTP's extensions typically take the form of filter programs
combined (using the CGI mechanism) with a server, HTTP is a poor choice for
supporting `fat' interfaces. In other words, HTTP/CGI is a good choice for
interfaces that are stateless and have a small number of entry points, but a
poor choice for stateful or large interfaces.

<P>
The widespread use of HTTP and the competition between various providers of
HTTP daemons has focused the attention of those server providers on important
considerations like system security and accounting. Thus, while providers of
HTTP software need to make high quality implementations of the HTTP protocol
available, there is also considerable effort expended towards additional
features which improve the overall function of any networked system. Because
using RPCs virtually necessitates rebuilding support features like access
control and logging, using HTTP can translate into significant savings during
the design, implementation and management phases of a project.

<P>
The widespread use of HTTP means that server programs for HTTP are likely to
exist on many of the would-be data-provider machines. Thus using HTTP will
remove one impediment from a user becoming a data provider, that is, to
become a data provider users will not necessarily have to install a data
server. The nature of RPC technology is such that data server installation is
typically considered complex by users and removing that hurdle improves the
accessibility of the system (since the system depends on, to a large extent,
the willingness of people to become data providers).

HTTP can be used to construct servers architecturally similar to
  those built with RPCs. (Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node5.html#fig:prog2client-server"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="file:/usr/share/latex2html/icons/crossref.png"></A>).  To
  do so the <EM>RPC server stub</EM> portion of the server is implemented
  using HTTPD and one or more <EM>Common Gateway Interfaces</EM> as shown in
  this figure.</CAPTION>
<TR><TD><IMG

<P>
While there are fundamental differences between RPC and HTTP,
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:http-interface"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="file:/usr/share/latex2html/icons/crossref.png"></A> shows how the <EM>RPC server stubs</EM> layer
in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node5.html#fig:prog2client-server"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="file:/usr/share/latex2html/icons/crossref.png"></A> can be constructed using one
implementation of HTTP and some additional software.  One crucial difference
between systems built with RPC and those built using HTTP is that the
RPC-based server can maintain state information while the HTTP-based server
cannot.  Thus, while servers based on RPC can use any convenient set of
functions as the server interface, the HTTP interface must be more carefully
chosen so as to insure that the system can function efficiently without state
information retained in the server.
