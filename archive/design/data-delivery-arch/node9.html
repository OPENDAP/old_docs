Data Delivery Architecture</A>
</H1>

<P>
DODS uses the client-sever paradigm to provide access to data across the
Internet. Each computer with on-line data can provide access to any user with
network access by installing one or more DODS data servers.  Users then
employ client programs to access data from the data servers. The data
delivery architecture for the entire distributed data system is the set of
DODS data servers and clients in existence at any given time. Because there
is no central authority which controls clients or servers, the system is in a
constant state of flux. In the future there will be a system which enables
users to search for servers with a particular type of data, but participation
in such a central registry is voluntary and is not part of the data delivery
architecture proper, rather the data delivery architecture consists solely of
the data servers and necessary client software.

<P>
The data delivery architecture does not rely on a centralized archive of
data, instead various data providers make relatively small amounts of data
available using their computers and data server software. Each user of data
can access the sum total of data from all the people or groups making data
available much as each user of a World Wide Web browser can access any
document made available through HTTP servers. While the contribution from
each individual is small, the total pool of data that users can access is
potentially huge.  Furthermore, the architecture of the DODS data delivery
mechanism is both general enough and simple enough to be used by individual
scientists and large agencies or groups of scientists. Thus the pool of data
which comprise DODS can be contributed by a wide variety of providers.

<P>
In the data delivery mechanism, the DODS <A NAME="tex2html24"
  HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/archive/design/api/api.html">data access protocol</A> is used to provide the
interface definition for a data server. However, each data server translates
the `calls' in the protocol to function calls in the API. These calls are
used to encode information contained in the data set.  Thus, DODS data access
is built around a family of data servers, defined by the set of data-access
APIs supported by DODS, all of which use the same data access
protocol<A NAME="tex2html21"

HREF="footnode.html#foot478"><SUP>5</SUP></A>.

<P>
An essential concept on which DODS bases its data delivery architecture is
that a significant percentage of existing data is stored in a documented
format or API<A NAME="tex2html23"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot479"><SUP>6</SUP></A>. This assumption ensures that there is a high return for time spent
developing data servers. If an API has been used to encode a large number of
different data sets, then a single type of data server (one for that API) can
be used to provide access to all those data sets. The assumption that the
interface to a data set (or type of data set) is well documented also reduces
the complexity of designing a data server.

<P>
A second essential concept is that many science-data APIs draw on a small set
of data models. These data models include relational sets, arrays,
hierarchies, etc. It should therefore be possible to construct data servers
which can translate some (or many) data sets from one API to another. This
will enable users of one of the DODS supported APIs to read most of the data
sets in any of the other supported APIs--not just data sets in one API.

<P>
The DODS data delivery architecture is flexible enough to support a wide
range of users. Some users will have a detailed understanding of the format
and content of a particular data set and should be able to use that
understanding to their advantage. Other users will have no prior knowledge of
format or content of the same data set and still should be able to access
that data in a meaningful way.

<P>
Supporting a wide range of data access, from data browsing to direct
access, means providing many different types of user applications which can
access data. In fact, the sum total of data browsing, visualization and
access software that even a single user might want is staggering.
Furthermore, much of that software has already been written, but typically
not with distributed access in mind and not for the specific format or API in
which the data a given user wants is encoded. Complicating the problem is the
wide range of data formats and APIs now available and the rate at which their
numbers are expanding. Trying to write a complete set of network tools would
be impossible. Before the tools were complete new formats/APIs
would need to be supported.

<P>
A solution to this problem that fits well with the idea of data servers
providing access based on APIs is to build replacement libraries for for
those APIs. These libraries present to a program the same set of functions
that the original implementation of the API presented, but replace the bodies
of those functions with code that access a data server rather than a local
resource. Any user program that was originally designed to work with one of
the supported APIs can be re-linked with the DODS implementation of that API
(called a `surrogate library' or a `client library') and access all of the
distributed resources of DODS. Thus, the parts of the data delivery
architecture that support data browsing, visualization and access are not
described here because DODS will rely on existing user programs to provide
those functions.

<P>
The DODS architecture supports data management by presenting the scientist
with a set of third-party tools for storing and organizing data. Each of
these tools provides support for representing information using one or more
data models. Furthermore, the inclusion of an API in DODS implies that the
API has been accepted by the scientific/oceanographic community and is thus
of use in organizing or accessing relevant data sets (i.e., we chose APIs
which are `popular' and feel that popularity implies acceptance). The set of
data models circumscribed by the set of supported APIs forms the set of data
models which the <A NAME="tex2html25"
  HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/archive/design/api/api.html">data access protocol</A> uses to describe and provide access to data
sets. Because the set of models is finite, it is possible that the user
community will want to add an API which uses a data model DODS knows nothing
about. In this case the <A NAME="tex2html26"
  HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/archive/design/api/api.html">data access protocol</A> must be extended to support the new data
model(s).

<P>
The complete data delivery architecture for DODS consists of data servers and
data sets located on computers throughout the Internet, combined with user
programs re-linked with DODS surrogate libraries. The set of data sets and
user programs are not limited to those that use DODS supported APIs and/or
formats. That a data set is accessible via a DODS data server and that a user
program is able to access data using the <A NAME="tex2html27"
  HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/archive/design/api/api.html">data access protocol</A> is the sole criteria for
membership in DODS.

<P>
The intent of this architecture is to make it as simple as possible for
scientists to access remote data. Using DODS servers, it should be possible
for many scientists to use programs already written to access new and
existing data sets stored on remote computers. The only preconditions their
programs must meet are that they must have been written using an API which
DODS supports and that they can be re-linked with the DODS implementation of
that API. Because the interface to the API remains exactly the same the user
program does not need to be modified in any way to access the remote data
available through DODS.
