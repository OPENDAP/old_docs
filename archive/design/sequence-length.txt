About the Sequence length `operator'.

In order to make sequence data simpler to translate into other data types
(principally arrays), the translating software needs to know the length of
the sequence. In some cases this may be hard or costly to determine. So,
rather than require that every DDS bind length information with each instance
of the Sequence data type, we have added a `length' operator to the CE
evaluator. Each server (i.e., DSP, JGOFS, ...) must support this by
specializing the Sequence::length() member function. Once specialized, the
function will return the length of the named sequence given the current CE.
If the length cannot be determined, will cost to much to determine or if the
member function has not been specialized.

Client programs must specifically query the server to get this length
information.
