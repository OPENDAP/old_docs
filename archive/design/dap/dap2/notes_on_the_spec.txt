Comments/Feedback from GMU (Liping Di, Donna Deng):

XDR encoding rules should be spelled out. In particular, describe how scalars
are sent, how arrays of bytes are sent and how arrays of types like int16 are
sent (it's fairly confusing). Just saying "like XDR" is not complete enough.

We must define the HTTP 1.1/1.0 rules. Which version is required? It may be
that the ODC confuses things because it does not support chunking.
