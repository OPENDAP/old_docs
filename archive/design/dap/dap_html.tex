\section{Introduction}

When one knows that data may be available from some \opendap server,
it is useful to be able to find out what data that might be.  Also,
because \DAP URLs are somewhat confusing for many people, it is useful
to provide a point-and-click way to build these URLs.  The \opendap
specification provides an HTTP service to aid these tasks. 

The reference implementation of the HTTP \DAP, supported by the
\opendap project, includes a server capacity to build interactive web
pages referring to the data served. This is good both for users trying
to navigate an \opendap server, and for those who simply want to find
out more detail about the data served.  This is not a required part of
the \DAP specification.  However, should other implementators of the
\DAP choose to implement this feature, they should do so as specified
in this document.

There are two aspects to the HTML response of the HTTP implementation.
The \HTML response provides data about a specific data file, and the
\DIR response provided data about what datasets might be available
there.

\section{\HTML}
\label{sec-html}

The \HTML response MUST present the user with an HTML document
that can be used to access values from the dataset. The document MUST show
all of the variables in the dataset along with their attributes and it MUST
show the dataset's attributes. Structural information SHOULD be preserved. 

The intent of the \HTML response it to provide a simple interface to
the dataset that can be used with a WWW browser.  Users should be able
to look at the variables in the dataset, read attributes and request
values without making multiple requests.

\Figureref{fig-ifh} contains a picture of an implementation of the
\HTML response.  This provides a form interface that allows users to
build an \opendap URL, request data with it, and either display the
data in the browser if it is returned as formatted ASCII data, or
download it or pipe it to some application program if it is returned
as binary data.

The \HTML response is triggered by a client using \lit{.html} as the
URL suffix.  See the discussion of \opendap URLs in \DAPHTTP.

\end{textoutput}



\section{\DIR}
\label{sec-dir}

The \DIR response is an HTML document that provides a simple way for
users to navigate among different datasets that may be accessed with a
particular server. The actual presentation mechanism is up to the
server implementor.  However, when datasets are represented in the
response there must be a URL which references the \HTML response for
that dataset.  The \HTML response and the \DIR response together make
a rudimentary browsing mechanism, allowing users to learn some of the
details of a server's datasets using a standard web browser.

\Figureref{fig-dir} contains a picture of an implementation of the
directory response.  The links there, such as the one labeled
\lit{sst.mnmean.nc} are actually links to the \HTML response for that
dataset.

{ifh-dir.ps}{ifh-dir.gif}%

The \DIR response is triggered by a URL that contains an
incomplete Dataset ID, composed only of a directory, and without the
filename part.
