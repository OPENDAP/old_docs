\section{HTTP Services}


\section{Requests}

\subsection{Responses}
\label{sec-resp-bodies}


The \INFO, \HTML or \DIR services all return HTML or plain
text documents. The \TEXT service returns data in a plain text document so
that it may be easily read into a spreadsheet or similar program. The \INFO
service formats information contained in the \DDS and \DAS objects
using HTML so that it may be displayed in a WWW browser. The \HTML
service returns a dynamic WWW form that can be used to request specific
variables from the data source. This service provides a low-level user
interface to a data source. The \DIR service provides a rudimentary form
of navigation for data sources which are composed of multiple files.

\subsubsection{\INFO}
\label{sec-info}

The \INFO response MUST present the user with an HTML document that
contains the dataset-specific information in the \DAX, as well as the
server-specific information in the \VER response and the \CapX.  This
intent is to present this information in a way that can be rendered by
a WWW browser.  Structural information about the dataset SHOULD be
preserved so that users can build \DAP URLs by hand.

The \INFO response MAY also return other information. If server
installers and/or dataset maintainers add HTML which describes the
dataset or the server, this information MUST be merged into the HTML
document returned in response to the \INFO request.

The purpose of the \INFO response is to supply information about the
dataset in a form that is easy for people to read. It should be
structured so that after only a little experience people can easily
assess a dataset using the document. In addition, the \INFO response
may be used in creating various user interfaces which access data
using \DAP servers.

The \INFO response should provide:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The hierarchical relation of container variables.
\item Each variable's datatype.
\item Each variable's attributes.
\item Any global attributes that the dataset contains.
\item Extra information supplied by the dataset creator/maintainer.
\item \CE functions available on this server.
\item The information from the \VER response.
\end{enumerate}

One implementation of the \INFO response uses HTML text in files
corresponding to each dataset served by a server, as well as HTML
documenting the server as a whole.  These documents are merged on the
fly to create the \INFO response, providing information both about the
server and the specific datasets in question.  

The \INFO response is triggered by a client using \lit{.info} as the
URL suffix.

\begin{textoutput}{Required Headers:}
XDODS-Server: dods/4.0\\
Content-Type: text/html\\
Date: \emph{date}
\end{textoutput}


\subsubsection{\HELP}
\label{sec-help}

The \HELP response MUST be returned when the server receives a URL
whose Dataset ID portion is \lit{help}.  It MAY reply with the \HELP
response when it receives a URL with no extension (i.e., a URL with no
Dataset ID at all).  This second option can interfere with the \DIR
response (see \Sectionref{sec-dir}) if your server keeps datasets in
the root-level directory.  In this case, the \DIR response MUST be
returned instead of the \HELP response in reply to a URL without a
Dataset ID.

\begin{ttfamily}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
abs\_path & = & server\_path dataset\_id "." ext [ "?" query ] \\
server\_path & = & <name of DAP server> \\
dataset\_id & = & "help" \\
ext & = & "" \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{ttfamily}

The \HELP response MUST return an HTML document which lists
the extensions recognized by the server. The response MAY return other
information as well.

\begin{textoutput}{Required Headers:}
XDODS-Server: dods/4.0\\
Content-Type: text/html\\
Date: \emph{date}

% \section{Encoding Values}
% \label{sec-rep-of-values}

% \emph{[Describe different types of variables as three groups: scalar, vector
%   and aggregate]}

% The \DAP uses Sun Microsystems' XDR protocol~\cite{xdr} for the external
% representation of all of the base type variables. Table~\ref{tab-base-xdr}
% shows the XDR types used to represent the various base type
% variables.

% \begin{table}
% \caption{The XDR data types used by the DAP as the external representations
%   of base-type variables}
% \label{tab-base-xdr}
% \begin{center}
% \begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
% \multicolumn{1}{|c}{\textsc{Base Type}} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textsc{XDR Type}} \\
% \hline \hline
% \lit{byte} & \lit{xdr byte} \\ \hline
% \lit{int16} & \lit{xdr short} \\ \hline
% \lit{uint16} & \lit{xdr unsigned short} \\ \hline
% \lit{int32} & \lit{xdr long} \\ \hline
% \lit{uint32} & \lit{xdr unsigned long} \\ \hline
% \lit{float32} & \lit{xdr float} \\ \hline
% \lit{float64} & \lit{xdr double} \\ \hline
% \lit{string} & \lit{xdr string} \\ \hline
% \lit{URL} & \lit{xdr string} \\ \hline
% \end{tabular}
% \end{center}
% \end{table}

% In order to transmit constructor type variables, the \DAP defines how the
% various base type variables, which comprise the constructor type variable,
% are transmitted. Any constructor type variable may be subject to a constraint
% expression which changes the amount of data transmitted for the variable (see
% Section~\ref{sec-ce}). For each of the six constructor types these
% definitions are:

% \begin{description}
  
% \item [Array] An array id first sent by sending the number of elements in the
%   array twice.\footnote{This is an artifact of the first implementation of
%     the DAP and XDR. The DAP software needed length information to allocate
%     memory for the array so it sent the array length. However, XDR also sends
%     the array length for its own purposes. This could be fixed but it is more
%     of an annoyance than anything else.} The array lengths are 32-bit
%   integers encoded using \lit{xdr\_long}.

%   Following the length information, each array element is encoded in
%   succession. Arrays of bytes are handled differently than other arrays:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item An array of bytes: These are encoded as is and are padded to a
%   four-byte boundary. Thus an array of five bytes will be encoded as eight
%   bytes.
  
% \item One dimensional arrays of all other types are encoded by encoding each
%   element of the array in the order they appear.

% \item Multi0dimensional arrays are encoded by encoding the elements using
%   row-major ordering.
% \end{enumerate}

% \begin{ttfamily}
% \begin{center}
% \begin{tabular}{lll}
% Array & = & length length values \\
% length & = & <32-bit integer, signed, big endian> \\
% values & = & bytes | other-values \\
% bytes & = & <8-bit bytes padded to a four-byte boundary> \\
% other-values & = & numeric-values | strings | aggregates \\
% \end{tabular}
% \end{center}
% \end{ttfamily}

% \item [List] A list is sent as if it were an array. Even though the length of
%   a list is not declared, at the time the list's value(s) are to be sent, its
%   length must be known. Thus it is possible to think of a list as a vector of
%   values and hence use the same encoding for those values as would be used
%   for an equivalent array.

% \item [Structure] A structure is sent by encoding each field in the order
%   those fields are declared in the structure. For example, the structure:

% \begin{vcode}{it}
% Structure {
%     int32 x;
%     float64 y;
% } a;
% \end{vcode}

% Would be sent by encoding the int32 \lit{x} and then the float64
% \lit{y}. 

% Nested structures are sent by encoding their `leaf nodes' as visited in a
% depth first traversal. For example:

% \begin{vcode}{it}
% Structure {
%     int32 x;
%     Structure {
%         String name;
%         Byte image[512][512];
%     } picture;
%     float64 y;
% } a;
% \end{vcode}

% Would be sent by encoding \lit{x}, then \lit{name}, \lit{image} and
%   finally \lit{y}.

% \item [Sequence] A Sequence is transmitted by encoding each instance as for a
%   structure and sending one after the other, in the order of their occurrence
%   in the data set. The entire sequence is sent, subject to the constraint
%   expression. In other words, if no constraint expression is supplied then
%   the entire sequence is sent. However, if a constraint expression is given
%   all the records in the sequence that satisfy the expression are
%   sent

%   Because a sequence does \emph{not} have a length count, each instance
%   is prefixed by a \lit{start of sequence} marker. Also, to accommodate
%   nested sequences, then end of each sequence as a whole is marked by a
%   \lit{end of sequence} marker.

% \begin{ttfamily}
% \begin{center}
% \begin{tabular}{lll}
% sequence & = & instances end-of-seq \\
% instances & = & start-of-inst instance-values \\
% end-of-seq & = & <byte value 0xA5> \\
% start-of-inst & = & <byte value 0x5A> \\
% \end{tabular}
% \end{center}
% \end{ttfamily}

% \item [Grid] A grid is encoded as if it is a Structure (one component
%   after the other, in the order of their declaration).

% \end{description}
