<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>This specification defines the protocol reffered to as "DAP/2.0." 
<p>The Data Access Protocol (DAP) is a presentation- and application-level protocol for
distributed access to data organized as name-datatype-value tuples. The
protocol has been used by Distributed Oceanographic Data System (DODS) since 1996. The first version of the
protocol delt only with the three psuedo-objects the DAP uses to describe
information sources. Version 2.0 added constraint expressions that provide a
way to extract part of a data source. In addition, version 2.0 added services
that integrate the DAP more with the rest of the The World Wide Web (WWW).
<p>While the name-datatype-value model is a nearly universal <em>conceptual</em>
organization of data, the actual organization takes nearly as many forms as
there are individual collections. Information in a computer
can often be broken down into a set of variables that have names, datatypes
and values. For example, data from a satellite might be stored in a named
array of bytes. However, there are many different file formats, APIs and
file/directory organizations used to house data.
<p>The DAP was designed to hide the implementation of different collections
of data behind a simple language-like interface based on the
name-datatype-value conceptual model. In practice this has worked well.
However, as the number of different implementations of the DAP
increases, it becomes more important that they all implement the same
protocol. 
<p>There are now several groups which have built servers
  supporting the
DAP. This document provides a concise description of the DAP to
simplify this task and to ensure that all the servers implement the same
protocol.
<p>As people apply the protocol to a wider variety of data sources, it also
becomes more likely that deficiencies in the protocol will appear. If the
DAP is found to fall short in some way, it should be extended and once
implemented, those extensions should be documented by amending this document
and incrementing the protocol's version number.
