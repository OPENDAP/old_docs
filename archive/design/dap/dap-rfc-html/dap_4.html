<h2>Overall Operation</h2>
<p>The DAP uses the request-response
paradigm. A client program issues a request and a named server returns a
response.  Once the server has returned a response, the interaction ends
until a new request is made. The DAP uses the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to frame the
request-response pair. 
<p>The DAP contains elements of both a presentation- and an
application-level protocol. The DAP defines ten different responses,
four of which are at the presentation-level; the remaining responses are
application-level.
<p>To represent a dataset the DAP uses three responses.
Two of these responses, the Dataset Descriptor Structure (DDS) and Dataset Attribute Structure (DAS), characterize the
variables, their datatypes, names and attributes. The
third response, the Data Dataset Descriptor Structure (DataDDS), holds data values along with name and
datatype information.  The three responses are complete in and of themselves
so that, for example, the data response can be used by a client without ever
requesting either of the two other responses.
<p>The DAP sends error information using an Error object. If a request for
any of the three basic responses cannot be returned, an Error response is
returned in its place.
<p>In addition to the three basic responses and the error response, the DAP
also defines several other responses which tie DAP servers closely to
the WWW. These additional responses build Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) or text documents
that can be interpreted by WWW browsers, HTML-aware spreadsheets,
<em>et cetera</em>. In most cases these documents are are created by first
accessing one or more of the three basic responses and interpreting their
contents.  Section&nbsp;<a HREF="dap_21.html">*</a> describes the different types of
responses.
<div class="quote" align="center">
  <b>Note:</b> The first implementation of the DAP was written in C++and the three basic responses correspond with objects in that
  implementation. For this reason these responses are referred to as
  `objects' in some of the DODS documentation. In some cases it is
  easier to think of these responses as objects and, in those cases, we will
  use that term in this paper, too. See Section&nbsp;<a HREF="dap_21.html">*</a> for a
  discussion of the object/response duality.
</div>
<p>Operationally, a DAP client sends a request to a server using HTTP.
The request consists of a HTTP GET request method, a
Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI)&nbsp;<a HREF="dap_43.html#rfc2396">[1]</a> that encodes information specific to DODS (see
Section&nbsp;<a HREF="dap_14.html">*</a>) and an HTTP protocol version number
followed by a MIME-like message containing various headers that further
describe the request. In practice, DAP clients use a third-party library
implementation of HTTP/1.1 so the GET request, URI and HTTP
version information are hidden from the client; it sees only the DAP
Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and some of the request headers. The DAP server responds with a
status line that includes the HTTP protocol version and an error or
success code, followed by a MIME-like message containing information about
the response and the response itself. The DAP response is the payload of
the MIME-like HTTP response.
