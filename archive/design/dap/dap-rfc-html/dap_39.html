<h3>INFO</h3>

<em>[Add text ...]</em>
<p>The <tt>info</tt> response MUST present the user with an HTML document
that contains the information in the DDS and DAS. This intent is to
present this information in a way that can be rendered by a WWW
browser. Structural information about the dataset SHOULD be preserved so that
users can build URLs by hand.
<p>The <tt>info</tt> response MAY also return other information. If server
installers and/or dataset maintainers add HTML which describes the
dataset or the server, this information MUST be merged into the HTML
document returned in response to the <tt>info</tt> request.
<p>The purpose of the <tt>info</tt> response is to supply information about the
dataset in a form that is easy for people to read. It should be structured so
that after only a little experience people can easily assess a dataset using
the document. In addition, the <tt>info</tt> response may be used in creating
various user interfaces which access data using DAP servers.
<p>The usage server should provide:
<ol><li>The hierarchical relation of container variables.
<li>Each variable's datatype.
<li>Each variable's attributes.
<li>Any global attributes that the dataset contains.
<li>Extra information supplied by the dataset creator/maintainer.
</ol>
<p>Mechanism:
<ol><li>Access to the HTML version of the usage information will be via a URL
  with the suffix <tt>.info</tt>.
<li>Dataset creators/maintainers will be able to supply a set
  of pseudo-HTML documents that will be concatenated with the information
  derived from the DAS and DDS objects.

Per-dataset HTML*:


    &lt;h3&gt;
    About the Fleet Numerical Ocean Winds dataset
    &lt;/h3&gt;

    The FNOC dataset is used as a sample dataset for testing of DODS. It is a
    `real' scientific dataset, but I really don't understand what it means.

    &lt;p&gt;

NB: This file must be in the same directory as the dataset. Note that the
same &lt;basename&gt;&lt;digits&gt;.html scheme used for the override file is used
here.

Per-server HTML*:

    &lt;h3&gt;
    Server Functions:
    &lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;dl&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;geolocate(variable, lat1, lat2, lon1, lon2)
    &lt;dd&gt;Returns the elements of &lt;em&gt;variable&lt;/em&gt; that fall within the box
    created by &lt;em&gt;lat1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;lon1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;lat2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;lon2&lt;/em&gt;.

    &lt;p&gt;

    &lt;dt&gt;time(variable, start\_time, stop\_time)
    &lt;dd&gt;Returns the elements of &lt;em&gt;variable&lt;/em&gt; that fall within the time
    interval &lt;em&gt;start\_time&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;stop\_time&lt;/em&gt;.
    &lt;/dl&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;

NB: This file must reside with the server. For the netcdf server (which is
made up of nph-nc, nc\_das, nc\_dds adn nc\_dods) this file is called nc.html).
</pre>
<li>There will be an override mode where only the user supplied HTML is
  returned. Thus if the automatically generated part of the server fails for
  a particular dataset the creator/maintainer can work around that problem.
<p>  If an override file is present, the <tt>info</tt> response MUST return that
  file INSTEAD of the automatically generated HTML document. The
  contents of the override file MUST be well formed HTML.
<p>  An override file is a file who's extension is <tt>.ovr</tt> and who's
  basename<sup><a HREF="dap_49.html#footnote-9">9</a></sup> matches that of the dataset of which the
  <tt>info</tt> request was made. This requirement is amended in one way; if
  a dataset's basename ends in a number, an override document need not
  include that number in its basename. In this case, the override document
  SHALL be applicable to all of the datasets which have a common basename not
  including the number if and only if an override file with a name which
  matches exactly is not present.
<p>  Some example dataset names and override files:
  <ul><li>[temp.ovr] Matches: temp.dat.
    <li>[fnoc.ovr] Matches: fnoc1.nc, fnoc2.nc, ..., fnoc10.nc. It does
      not match fnocx.nc.
    <li>[fnoc1.ovr] Matches: fnoc1.nc and fnoc10.nc but not fnoc2.nc. But
      if a fnoc10.ovr file is present that must take precedent.
  </ul>
</ol>
