<H2><A NAME="SECTION00022000000000000000">
Client/Server and Program/Library Interfaces</A>
</H2>

<P>
The DODS client library and data server programs communicate information
using URLs and MIME documents.
Figures&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:data-transport"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="file:/usr/share/latex2html/icons/crossref.png"></A>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:url-params"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="file:/usr/share/latex2html/icons/crossref.png"></A> show these two
communication paths.

<P>
All information sent from the filter programs to the client library is
enclosed in a MIME document. Two of the three programs return information
about the variables contained in the data set as <TT>text/plain</TT> MIME
documents. These documents can then be parsed by software in the client
library. In addition, these text documents can be read by any software that
can process <TT>ASCII</TT> text. Thus, the responses made by the server are
specifically suited to use by the DODS client libraries, they can also be
used by many more general programs. For example, it is possible the use a
general purpose World Wide Web browser to `read' these documents.

<P>
The third filter program returns binary data encoded using Sun Microsystems
External Data representation (XDR) scheme prefixed with text which descibes
the data type of the binary information<A NAME="tex2html30"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot481"><SUP>3</SUP></A>. The data
is enclosed in a binary MIME document whose subtype is experimental. This
document can be read by software that is part of the client library using
additional information about the data set that is stored as state information
by the client library. Because correct interpretation of this document
requires knowledge of the format of the binary information, it is not
possible for general purpose WWW browsers to interpret this file (although
most browsers can read and save to disk any arbitrary data).

<P>
In order to provide link-time compatibility with the original API libraries,
the DODS client libraries must present <EM>exactly</EM> the same external
interface as the original libraries. However, these new libraries perform
very different operations on the data (although, for a API used to access a
self-describing data format the operations are analogous). One difference
between the two is that most data access APIs use file names to refer to data
sets. In the simplest case these file names are given on the command line by
the user and passed, without modification, to the API. The API uses the file
name to open a file and returns an identifier of some type to the user
program. Subsequent access to the data are made through this identifier.

<P>
In this simple scenario, it is possible to substitute a URL in place of a
file name (in part because both are stored in string-type variables). This
same user program can be invoked, on the command line, using a URL in place
of the file name. The program will, in almost all cases, pass the URL to the
API to open the data set. However, since the user program has been re-linked
with the DODS re-implementation of the API, the functions in the API will
correctly interpret the URL as a remote reference (see
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node15.html#ddd:client-lib-open"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="file:/usr/share/latex2html/icons/crossref.png"></A>). Clearly, one requirement that a user
program must meet in order to be re-linked with DODS is that it must not
itself try to open or otherwise manipulate the `file name' which will be
passed to the API<A NAME="tex2html31"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot484"><SUP>4</SUP></A>.

<P>
As shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:url-params"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="file:/usr/share/latex2html/icons/crossref.png"></A>, the client library does manipulate
the URL used to access the data set. A DODS data server is actually comprised
of three programs which each respond to a different type of data as described
by the <A NAME="tex2html34"
  HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/archive/design/api/api.html">Data Access Protocol</A>. These programs are accessed as WWW documents via the HTTPD using
the CGI mechanism. By <EM>convention</EM> the data set name consists of the
HTTP access string (<TT>http://</TT>) followed by the machine name and a string
which the data providers choose depending on the name and location of the
dispatch CGI and the data. In order to read the DAS, DDS or data, this URL is
modified, again by convention, by adding a suffix. The three suffixes
currently (as of 23 August 1996) recognized are <TT>.das</TT> for the dataset attribute
structure, <TT>.dds</TT> for the dataset descriptor structure, and <TT>.dods</TT>
for binary data.
