Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>
This document describes the design and construction of the data delivery
components of the <A NAME="tex2html13"
  HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/">Distributed Oceanographic Data System</A> (DODS). The architecture of DODS is described in
detail in ``<A NAME="tex2html14"
  HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/archive/design/data-delivery-arch/data-delivery-arch.html">DODS--Data Delivery Architecture</A>''.  DODS is a client-server system which differs from the
conventional notion of such a system, such as <TT>ftp</TT>, because it has many
different clients, not just one.  Instead of the implementor(s) of DODS
building a single client program to read and display data, they build
replacements for existing data access application programmer interfaces
(API). These replacement, or surrogate, API implementations are then linked
to any data access, display or analysis software which uses that API to
access data. The surrogate API implementations use the DODS tool kit, in
conjunction with the <A NAME="tex2html15"
  HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/Overview.html">HTTPD</A>, to access data stored on remote computers which
have installed DODS data servers.  Because the reimplemented APIs can access
data over the network using DODS data servers, application programs linked
with them can also access such data, even though the API calls they make are
unchanged.

<P>
In addition to the remote access of data sets, DODS provides a limited degree
of API transparency. The DODS data servers transmit information using the
<A NAME="tex2html16"
  HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/archive/design/api/api.html">Data Access Protocol</A> (DAP).  The DODS surrogate libraries issue requests and read data using
the DAP, while the DODS data servers answer requests and provide information
using the DAP as well. Both the surrogate libraries and the data servers can
be said to <EM>translate</EM> the native access mode of a API or storage
format into or out of the DAP. Because a single transmission/access protocol
is used to move all information within DODS, any surrogate library can, in
principle, access data from any of the data servers, regardless of the
storage format of the data accessed by that server. Thus, for example, data
stored in <A NAME="tex2html17"
  HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/guide.txn_toc.html">NetCDF</A> files can be read using software designed to work with the
<A NAME="tex2html18"
  HREF="http://www1.whoi.edu/jgofs.html">JGOFS</A> system.

<P>
Using the <A NAME="tex2html19"
  HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/archive/design/api/api.html">data access protocol</A> has a price. Servers must translate calls in the DAP to calls
in the data set API or, if the data set has no associated API, to various
reads which get information from the data set. Either way the data server
must translate the DAP accesses into the appropriate accesses for the data
set. Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node5.html#ddd:data-servers"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="file:/usr/share/latex2html/icons/crossref.png"></A> describes the design and construction of
these data servers. In addition, the surrogate libraries must translate calls
from the API they replace to calls in the DAP. Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node13.html#ddd:client"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="file:/usr/share/latex2html/icons/crossref.png"></A>
describes how these surrogate libraries are built.

<P>
Several designs were considered for the data delivery mechanism of DODS.
They were socket-based peer-to-peer communications, RPC-based peer-to-peer
communications, virtual file systems and HTTP/CGI-based client/server
systems. The first three of these different designs are compared in: <A NAME="tex2html20"
  HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/archive/reports/workshop1/section3.13.html">Report on the First Workshop for the
    Distributed Oceanographic Data System, Proposed System Architectures</A>
and ``<A NAME="tex2html21"
  HREF="http://lake.mit.edu/dods-dir/dods-dd.html">DODS--Data Delivery</A>'', which presents our rationale behind prototyping the RPC-based
design for DODS. However, as a result of those prototypes and the development
of HTTP as a <EM>de facto</EM> data communications standard, we changed the
data delivery design to an HTTP/CGI-based system.

<P>
By using HTTP as a transport protocol, we are able to tap into a large base
of existing software which will likely evolve along with the Internet as a
whole. Because the development of large-scale distributed systems is
relatively new<A NAME="tex2html12"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot453"><SUP>1</SUP></A> there are many problems which must still be addressed
for these systems to be robust. These problems include naming resources
independently of their physical location, and choosing between two objects
which appear to be the same but which differ in terms of quality. These are
general problems which are hard to solve because they will be solved
effectively only when the Internet community reaches a consensus on which of
the available solutions are best. HTTP, because it is so widely accepted,
provides a reasonable base for such solutions. This view is supported by the
recent <A NAME="tex2html22"
  HREF="http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/home.html">Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF)</A>
work on extending the
<A NAME="tex2html23"
  HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/HTTP2.html">HyperText Transfer Protocol</A> and standards.
