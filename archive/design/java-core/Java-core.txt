My Plan for writing the Java core software:

1) Write a replacement for DAS & AttrTable.
    - Take the DAS.h and AttrTable.h files and clone the interface with
      an empty Java Class 
    - Document each of the Java class's mfuncs.
    - Pick someone to check my empty class to make sure that all the
      functionality of DAS/AttrTable is present in my Java DAS class.
    - Once it seems that I have the functionality covered (I might do it a
      different way but the new class(es) should have capabilities as the
      existing DAS/AttrTable code) I'll fill in the guts.

2) Analyze this to see if its going to work for writing the other classes.
    - Can I hack something that can use the new JDAS/jAttrTable (or whatever)
      to read from a server? 
    - What other things should I be looking at?

I'm picking the DAS/AttrTable code because it is much simpler than the DDS
and related code and because I think that the stuff in Java that will be
analogous to Connect or DODSFilter will be so different I might have to redo
it from the ground up.

My guess is that I can estimate coding times pretty closely for the DDS and
other stuff by keeping track of how much time the DAS takes.

Comments?
