<h2>The difierences between this and the C++ implementation</h2>

A <a href="jDAP/jDAP.html">paper describes the differences</a> between this
implementation of the DODS DAP and the C++ implementation. The later is
described by the programmer's Guide on the <a
href="http://unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/">DODS web page</a>. Note that
this paper is almost a year old and was written <em>before</em> the DODS Java
software was itself written. It contains some errors.

<h2>How This Document Is Organized</h2>

<blockquote>

<h3>Color coding used in the documentation:</h3>
The fields, constructors and methods have additional color coding as follows:
<dl>
<dd><img src="images/magenta-ball.gif"> Instance Variable (Non-Static Field)
<dd><img src="images/blue-ball.gif"> Static Field (Class Variable)
<dd><img src="images/yellow-ball.gif"> Constructor
<dd><img src="images/red-ball.gif"> Instance Method (Non-Static Method)
<dd><img src="images/green-ball.gif"> Class Method (Static Method)
</dl>

<h3>All Classes and Interfaces within this Package</h3>

<a href="packages.html">Packages</a>

<p>
This page provides links to the public classes and interfaces 
in a given package. It can contain four categories:
<ul>
<li>Interfaces
<li>Classes
<li>Exceptions
<li>Errors
</ul>

<h3>Class Hierarchy</h3>
The <a href="tree.html">Class Hierarchy</a> contains a list of all the 
classes and interfaces starting with java.lang.Object, 
organized first by their inheritance structure, 
and within that structure sorted alphabetically by class or interface.  
Most every page has a "Class Hierarchy" link in the navigation bar 
to get to this page.

<h3>Index of Fields and Methods</h3>
The <a href="AllNames.html">Index of Fields and Methods</a> 
contains a list of all fields, methods and constructors, 
sorted alphabetically. Most every page has an "Index" link in the
navigation bar to get to this page.
