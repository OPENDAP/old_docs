This documents the CGI dispatch mechanism. Some of the information in this
document is old (most, in fact) but is scattered throughout source code; I am
writing this so that all documentation on the CGI mechanism can use one file
for a reference. The CGI dispatch scripts and filter programs should match
the spec laid out in this file.

The dispatch scripts should recognize 5 extensions: das, dds, dods, info and
ver. Each are separated from the filename part of a URL by a dot. The
extensions cause the server to return the DAS, DDS, Data, Info and Version
objects respectively. NB: The Info `object' is an HTML document and the
Version object is plain text. In addition, each dispatch script should
recognize the pseudo-filename `version' as a request for the Version object.

Version information will be return using the -v option of the data filter
mated with the particular dispatch script (e.g., for nph-nc that would be
nc_dods). When requesting version information using the pseudo-filename
`version', the program will return the version of the server (both the number
of the dispatch script and the core software used to build the filter
programs). When using the extension `.ver' the version returned will include
the version of the dataset as well. This means that the extension must be
used in conjunction with a valid dataset `filename'.
