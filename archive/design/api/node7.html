The Data Model</A>
</H2>

<P>
Data models provide a way to organize scientific data sets so that useful
relationships between individual datum are evident. Many data models have
been specifically designed to make using the data in a computer program
simpler. Examples of computationally oriented data models for scientific data
are hierarchical, sequential, and gridded data models. 

<P>
Data models are abstract, however, and to be used by a computer program they
must first be implemented by a programmer. Often this implementation takes
the form of an API--a library of functions which can read and write data
using a data model or models as guidance. Thus every data access API can be
viewed as implementing some data model, or in some cases several data models.

<P>
Because DODS needs to support several very different data models, it is
important to design it around a core set of concepts that can be applied
equally well to each of those data models. If that can be done, then
translation between data represented in those different models may be
possible.

<P>
Currently DODS supports two very different data access APIs: netCDF and
JGOFS. The netCDF API is designed for access to gridded data, but has some
limited capabilities to access sequence data (although not with all of its
supported programming language interfaces). The JGOFS API provides access to
relational or sequence data<A NAME="tex2html12"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot857"><SUP>2</SUP></A>.
Both APIs support access in several programming languages (at least C and
Fortran) and both provide extensive support for limiting the amount of data
retrieved.  For example a program accessing a gridded data set using netCDF
can extract a subsampled portion or <EM>hyperslab</EM> of that data.  Likewise,
the JGOFS API provides a powerful set of operators which can be used to
specify which type of sequence elements to extract (e.g., only those
corresponding to data captured between 12:01am and 11:59am) as well as
masking certain parameters from the returned elements so that only those
parameters needed by the program are returned.

<P>
The DODS DAP uses the concepts of variables and operators as the base for the
data model. Within the data model, a data set consists of one or more
variables where each variable is described formally by a number of
attributes.  Variables associate names with each component of a data set, and
those names are used to refer to the components of the data set. In addition
to their different attributes, it is possible to operate on individual
variables or named collections of variables. The principal operation is <EM>  access</EM>, although this can be modified in a number ways.
