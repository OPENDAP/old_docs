<P>
Most data access APIs are targeted at application writers--they provide
powerful tools to read, write, and process one specific type of scientific
data and are typically specialized so that software in one application domain
is easy to write. In order to fulfill this function, APIs are typically
`feature rich' (i.e., they provide many ways to perform similar tasks). This
characteristic causes APIs that maintain this level of flexibility over a
wide range of data types to become very complex. Because simplicity and
ease-of-use are two characteristics that make APIs attractive to application
programmers, most API designers try to limit the scope of an API so that it
can provide the features application programmers want, at the level of detail
they want, without becoming excessively large and thus burdensome to use.
The netCDF and JGOFS APIs are good examples of APIs designed for a specific
type of application.  Each is used to access earth-science data sets, but
netCDF is most suited to gridded model data, and JGOFS has direct support
only for relational data.

<P>
However, the netCDF API cannot be directly used to access data sets produced
by the JGOFS API and vice versa. An application using either one of these
APIs would need to be modified if a user wanted to integrate both netCDF and
JGOFS compliant data sets. Modifying a program so that the data access API it
uses matches with the API used to write a data set is an expensive process
and one which is exacerbated by the fact that more and more users do not
write their own software. Modifying someone else's software can be very
complex and costly at best; at worst it is not possible at all.  Moreover,
when the data sets are remote it may be impossible to convince their
maintainers to replicate them for another API since this, too, is very
costly.

<P>
One alternative to rewriting application software or replicating data is to
define an intermediate representation which can be used to access data stored
in any one of a number of APIs.  If the intermediate representation is based
on a data model that encompasses the abstractions of a certain set of APIs,
then the intermediate representation can be used to translate between those
APIs. The implementation of an intermediate representation interface need not
be an application interface itself; instead it can be a set of tools used to
build application-level components. These components can then be combined at
link-time and/or runtime with user-programs to access data.

<P>
An interface which is to be used as a translation mechanism cannot afford to
present the rich set of access functions that the individual APIs, which it
subsumes, present. It must control the size and complexity of its interface by
removing features while still providing the capability to transparently
interoperate between several data models.  The DODS DAP is such an interface.
It is designed to be used in the construction of system components which are
configured at runtime by users, maintainers or other software components.
Thus, the DODS DAP is not a separate addition to the set of interfaces formed
by JGOFS, netCDF, and others.  Instead it is an intermediate representation
which can be used to translate between those different APIs.
