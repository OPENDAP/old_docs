Introduction
</H1>

<P>
The <A NAME="tex2html5"
  HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/">Distributed Oceanographic Data System</A> (DODS) Data Access Protocol (DAP) is a <EM>lingua franca</EM> for
reading earth science data sets. It is used as an intermediate representation
for data which are nominally accessed using an established third-party
Application Programmer Interface (API) (e.g., netCDF). Because, in addition
to a method for data access, the DAP defines the content of ancillary
information about data sets, it provides the means to access data sets
through a single protocol using any of the DODS supported APIs. Because the
<A NAME="tex2html6"
  HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/archive/design/api/api.html">data access protocol</A> serves as an intermediate representation for several different APIs, it
can be used to translate between any two of those APIs.

<P>
In <A NAME="tex2html7"
  HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/archive/design/data-delivery-arch/data-delivery-arch.html">DODS--Data Delivery Architecture</A>, an architecture is described that uses third party APIs to access
data stored on remote computers. In that document, it is assumed that users
of those data write programs in which those data are accessed using an API.
For DODS, this assumption is advantageous because it limits the class of
programs which DODS must address to those which use a formally defined
interface for data access. For the user, it is advantageous to use an API
because the storage format of the data is both hidden from the user and
separated from the user program source code, resulting in programs which take
less time to write and modify and which are more likely to be correct.

<P>
Most data access APIs do not provide direct access to distributed
data<A NAME="tex2html4"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot854"><SUP>1</SUP></A>. The DODS data delivery
architecture describes how such a capability can be added to an API.
Reimplementing an API using the DODS software <A NAME="tex2html8"
  HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/archive/implementation/toolkits/toolkits.html">client and server toolkit</A> provides the
necessary bridge between the API's function calls and the network
communication infrastructure necessary to allow the API to access distributed
data sets.

<P>
Once users have the power to access remotely stored data they realize that
not all data are available using the API that they use. In fact, many data
sets' storage formats are incompatible with third party APIs altogether
because they are stored using conventions independently developed at the site
where the data were first analyzed, collected, or archived. While those in
charge of the data at a remote site may be very willing to provide remote
access, they will probably not be willing to reformat their data for most
off-site users.  How do users access remote data when it is not stored in a
format or data model their programs understand?

<P>
The DODS Data Access Protocol provides a means to access data sets using any
one of a set of supported APIs by defining an intermediate representation for
data sets, and components of data sets, that is API and format independent.
Using the DODS DAP as an intermediate representation, software components can
be built which translate a user program's API calls into DAP calls. Data
servers can be built which accept DAP calls and, either by translating
into a third-party API or using data set-local access methods, read the data.
Thus software which uses any one of a set of APIs can be used to read data so
long as a DODS server for that data exists--even if the data is stored in an
API different from the one used by the display or analysis software.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In a previous design, the DODS data delivery system contained
reimplementations of the supported APIs which used the API entry points as
the remote access interface definition; the set of calls to which a remote
data server responds. However, this design did not facilitate multi API
access (i.e., API translation) to data sets.
