Southeast Regional Workshop


National Ocean Partnership Program, Virtual Ocean Data Hub 
(VODHub)

 Distributed Oceanographic Data System (DODS)















November 17th – 19th, 2000
NOAA – Coastal Services Center
Charleston, SC

Introduction and Workshop Objectives

Anne Ball, SE regional DODS coordinator, convened the workshop at 9:00 am.  The workshop 
facilitator was Steve Bliven.  The objectives of the workshop were stated as follows:
- To familiarize workshop attendees with the DODS server and client.
- Determine whether DODS meets the needs of organizations in the southeast.
- Develop a list of issues/suggestions to ensure the success of DODS.
- Determine how to best implement DODS in the southeast.

All the workshop participants introduced themselves and provided information on what 
organizations they represented.  See Appendix A for a listing of workshop attendees.

Background on DODS

Peter Cornillon of the University of Rhode Island (URI) provided a brief history of DODS.  The 
conception of DODS was started in the early ‘90s and is based on two different client-server 
systems; one that looked at satellite data and another that looked at in-situ data.  A meeting in 
1992 discussed the development of building an “umbrella” client-server system that incorporates 
both of the above client-server systems into one.  The first workshop had forty attendees and was 
held at URI to discuss a distributed system.  Initially, the system was not supposed to be 
constrained to oceanography but the realization was that it was not possible to build a system to 
encompass other disciplines.  As a result, the Distributed Ocean Data System evolved and was to 
be UNIX based.  Over time and a series of other workshops, the National Ocean Partnership 
Program (NOPP) awarded DODS a grant to develop a Virtual Ocean Data Hub system.

The first year of the proposed NOPP system was to get community buy-in.  Five regions were 
formed: Northeast, Southeast, Gulf Coast, West Coast, and Great Lakes (which was dropped and 
replaced by one focusing on GIS) to hold workshops and led by regional coordinators.  They 
have control over how to run each of the workshops and how to spend allocated money in the out 
years of the proposal.  Each of the regional coordinators have an interest in oceanography but are 
from differing backgrounds with the idea of bringing as much input as possible to the overall 
effort.  Based on the five reports generated by each of the regional workshops, a final report will 
be generated which will be utilized by a national workshop.  After the national workshop is held 
an overall report discussing recommendations for the DODS project will be developed.  A 
technical meeting will then be held to discuss the technical findings and recommendations of the 
national report. 

Overview and Demonstration of  DODS

Before going into a demonstration of  DODS, a document describing DODS was passed out to 
each of the participants, (Appendix B).  Listed below are some the highlights of the 
DODS system as it was presented to the workshop participants.

Peter explained the five steps involved to analyze data:
LOCATE
SUBSET
ACQUIRE
INGEST
ANALYZE

The DODS portion involves the middle three steps, i.e., SUBSETTING, ACQUIRING, and 
INGESTING.  DODS doesn’t focus on LOCATION or ANALYSIS.  What DODS is not and the 
underlying philosophy of DODS were covered.

Peter went on to explain that DODS is built from the bottom up, i.e., by putting high 
functionality at the data acquisition level and that functionality decreases from the bottom up 
(data level being at the bottom, the inventory level in the middle and the directory level at the 
top).

The underlying philosophy of DODS was reiterated and is twofold:
- Anyone willing to share their data should be able to do so via DODS.
- The user should be able to use the application package with which she or he is the most 
familiar to examine or analyze the data of interest.

Constraints of the DODS system include making it easy for the scientist to serve data AND to 
make it easy to access data.

Syntactic and semantic metadata were described and how they relate to the data, inventory, and 
directory levels.  Semantic metadata can be sub-setted into use and search categories.  Use 
metadata can be further subdivided into translational use metadata and descriptive use metadata. 
The focus of DODS is on translational use metadata.

Four levels of interoperability at the data level (for data accessible over the network) were 
explained as follows:
?	Level 0 – no syntactic or semantic metadata – FTP.
?	Level 1 – rigid syntactic, no semantic metadata – DODS
?	Level 2 – rigid syntactic, human readable semantic metadata – A subset of DODS data 
sets.
?	Level 3 – rigid syntactic, consistent semantic metadata; i.e., machine-readable – A subset 
of the DODS Level 2 data sets.

Before going into the first demonstration on the use of DODS, three DODS data objects were 
defined:
1. The data descriptor structure (.dds), this is the syntactic metadata for a data set.
2. The data attribute structure (.das), this is the semantic metadata for a data set.
3. Data – the actual data in binary structure.

Additionally, DODS servers support several other services: 
?	.ASCII – an ASCII representation of the data.
?	.info – a more readable version of the .dds and .das combined.
?	.html form – web based form that will help to build a DODS URL.

A demonstration was given on how to access a WOCE/TOPEX data set, which was copied from 
CD-ROM to a server machine at URI.  In order to access data, Peter requested data from a 
DODS server via URLs.  The URL was then passed to httpd via a DODS client.  At this point the 
DODS client enters the data into an application from the DODS server via httpd.  Any data sub-
setting is done at the server.  It was emphasized that writing DODS URLS can be difficult!

Three classes of interfaces were described based on the difficulty involved in building a URL.  
These are in order of increasing ease-of-use:
?	COMMAND LINE 
?	GENERAL PURPOSE URL 
?	GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE 

Another demonstration was given showing the functionality of the DODS Dataset Access Form 
to access the TOPEX dataset.  More buttons will be added to this form in the future.

The DODS data model was explained along with the data model constraints.  The following 
operations are permitted when requesting data:
?	Projection.
?	Relational operations on list and sequence elements.
?	Rectangular and decimated subsets of arrays and grids.

Issues raised:

After the first live demo on the usage of DODS, the floor was opened up for discussion. Some of 
the questions and comments were as follows:

1. Regarding a user that has data and wants to make it available in DODS (how is this done)?
Answer:
- You must know what form the data are in.
- Go to the DODS home page and download a server (better documentation is needed on the 
servers).
- Have to know what server software to down-load (download the binary).
- Select a server and then select either HDF or NetCDF version.
- Select UNIX.
- Have pointer.

Peter stated that they (DODS developers at URI) would like to have a web site describing how to 
do the download.  He preferred that people use URI’s selection of servers.  Money will come 
from URI to support server installation.  In the proposal, Peter thought that each region would 
either: 
- Hire an individual to use the money to help install servers.
- OR get a sub-contract for people to install their own servers.

He stated that it is really up to the regions on how they want to do it and that the region perhaps 
should identify some high priority sites for server installation in the region.

2. Regarding standards on what a server should look like after tweaking?
Answer:
- Installation should follow a certain protocol.
- Support should come through web site.
- Dan Holloway handles server side issues.
- James Gallagher handles the technical questions.
- They want to track the questions as they come in.

3. If you have other systems in place and want to install a DODS server, are you creating 
problems related to the other servers?
Answer:
- Putting a DODS server on your system does not impact existing servers.

4. Can curvilinear data be handled?  Can DODS be extended?
Answer:
- Unsure as to why URI couldn’t deal with this issue now.

5. The efficiency of the data model is a concern for complex data sets.  It was thought that if the 
DODS data model was tweaked a little bit, these problems might be resolved.  This is a 
translational use metadata issue.

6.  A question was raised on how DODS deals with data compression.
Answer:
- DODS uses standard compression techniques.

7. Why is DODS not a data locator?
Answer:
- The core of the DODS project is how you move data around.
- They are working in the direction of the data locator issue.
- Have a contract to develop a web-crawler based on the DODS Dir function.

8. Peter sees three issues facing the group (to this point in the workshop):
- Moving the data around in a system-efficient way?
- Adding additional “bells and whistles” to DODS.
- What data do you want served?

9. Comments regarding rigidity of metadata standards.
- Imposing standards as a group.
- Nothing precluding users from making own decisions on metadata.

Peter gave two more demonstrations:

1.  Live Access Server to PMEL Data
Steps involved:
- Parse request that is sent.
- Pass request on to Ferret (a NetCDF program).
- Ferret then requests a subset from the server site and moved over the network.
- Data is then returned to browser.
- If a server is down, some data won’t show up.
- Select COADS data (sea surface temperature).
- Live Access Server returns a .gif image.

(Peter noted that there is a lot of metadata available on the PMEL site.)

2. Demo using Matlab.
- Peter showed various functionalities using DODS and the Live Access Server.

Discussion on server related issues

Metadata:

Issues concerning metadata were numerous and varied.  Peter re-stated that only syntactic 
metadata is required to run DODS and that the server (either FreeForm or JGOFS) will provide 
the metadata.  The user is NOT required to provide semantic metadata.  He indicated that it’s OK 
if metadata is bound to the data being served.  A few additional points were stated regarding 
DODS and metadata:
- One should not have to reformat or restructure their metadata for the DODS .das file.
- DODS will take advantage of what it can in regard to metadata but can’t guarantee that it will 
take advantage of the structure.
- Some sites have extensive metadata on the web.
- Should the .das take up the metadata that’s not in FGDC or any other format is still an 
unresolved question.

Other metadata issues/comments/suggestions:

 The attribute structure of the translational use metadata should have a minimum of elements, 
i.e., names, observations, variables, units, and missing values.
1. The SE regional workgroup should require at minimum a text file with translational use 
metadata information.
2. An assumption that DODS can associate FGDC compliant metadata that may or may not 
be generated by NOAA or a third party and associate that with a DODS dataset.
3. In response to item #3, third party metadata cannot be handled yet and would require a 
modification to the DODS core.
4. Researchers like to have a breadth of information available for their use.  Quality flags 
are an issue.
5. A central link between a dataset and the metadata would be desirable.
6. Peter stated that he would try to work out issues with FGDC metadata.  He said that he 
would try to handle third party metadata generators even though this went philosophically 
against the DODS mission.  As a data transport protocol, they (URI DODS team) will 
make a provision to make metadata available but will not impose the requirement on the 
data provider on how that metadata is distributed.  They will also try to handle other 
metadata that’s not in a well-defined structure, i.e., on a web page.  This could possibly 
be done by incorporating the web page into the .das or have a URL pointed to the web 
page in the .das.
7. DODS shouldn’t have to force people to provide metadata.
8. Possibly use a middleman to deliver the metadata.
9. Work closely with data providers to come up with more useful metadata.
10. Data providers should provide a URL link to their metadata.
11. Concerns that DODS does not address the metadata issue more seriously.

Liability:

The issue of having a disclaimer with served data was discussed.  In many situations in the 
southeast, disclaimers are necessary/required to satisfy the South Carolina General Council.  One 
opinion was that disclaimers should be located on the client end.  Also, the southeast region 
would/should not be allowed to put up a DODS server for data that has disclaimers unless they 
(the region) could be insured that they see the disclaimer first.

Data Formats and Storage:

Data formats in the southeast region include ASCII files, ACCESS, EXCEL, Oracle, SEQUEL, 
INFORMIX, SYBASE, and others.  Peter suggested that the region identify how many users are 
out there that use these packages and from that list, accommodate those users.  He pointed out 
that DODS needs to make it trivial to install servers for simple datasets.

Suggestions/comments concerning servers:

1. The southeast region should come up with a matrix listing available DODS servers that are 
out there and the various data types that need to be served. 
2. In what format are the different data types stored in (INFORMIX, Oracle, SYBASE, or just 
ASCII files)?
3. Some level of data management on the server side will be needed.
4. Money will have to be spent on managing data.
5. DODS servers cannot handle Microsoft EXCEL and ACCESS files yet.  Peter will 
investigate this.

Types of Servers:

Peter pointed out that the DODS core is available for all windows accessed NT machines, 
Matlab, IDL, Ferret, Linux 5.4 and 6.1, Polaris operating machine, DEC Alpha, and others.
Some workshop participants indicated that they would require tech support to install servers, 
others said that they could handle it themselves.  Still others indicated that they need a certain 
level of commitment from principal investigators before server installation.

Discussion on client related issues

Based on the demonstration of the DODS system, workshop participants indicated that they 
would like to make the data more accessible without a client machine, or put another way, use 
the client side of DODS in the browser.  Additionally, it would be desirable if the functionality 
of the browser could be “beefed up” to make it more of a point-and-click interface.

The question was put out as to who the data users were in the group.  Several members of the 
group indicated that they used SAS.  Others indicated that used EXCEL, ACCESS, and 
ArcINFO products.  Peter indicated that NGDC and ESRI might collaborate to build DODS 
servers in DODS format.  The objective is to support the GIS data model in DODS.  A timeline 
of eighteen months was given to complete the task.

Two questions were posed related to the client:
1. Can metadata be updated from Matlab?
Answer:
You can update metadata over the web in Matlab format in a particular structure.
2. On what platforms are clients available?
Answer:
Clients are available on all platforms that they support (command line client).

At this point, John Ellis provided a demonstration of the National Coastal Data Development 
Center (NCDDC) web site being built at Stennis Space Center.
In brief, the NCDDC system is:
- A virtual data hub, which supports data discovery, based on FGDC metadata records.
- A data delivery process, which directs a user request to the appropriate server capability.
- At the moment, DODS is a server option from the pull-down menu giving a URL listing of 
available DODS servers.

NCDDC currently has two web sites, one operational and one developmental.

At this point in the workshop, a lengthy discussion took place regarding the functionality of a 
web browser interface on the client side that many thought would be utilized to preview data 
before using DODS.  Many ideas were put on the table as to what that functionality should be.  
In summary, participants felt those functions should include:

LOCATION/SUBSETTING 
?	Graphics (rubber-banding).
?	Coordinates (typing in ranges or geographic regions).
?	Consistency (Boolean operations) for searching.
?	Space/time/variable (keyword) processing and acquisition.
?	Will be designed the way NCDDC system works (similar to FGDC clearinghouse).
?	Select by sub-setting.

MANIPULATION
?	May want to see mean value.
?	Count by values (e.g., percent clear skies).
?	NICE, BUT NOT NOW!  (Can be done by Java Applet).

DISPLAY
?	Properties of data.
?	Graphics.
?	Relationship between variables.
?	Disclaimer information (constraints to using data).
?	Volume of data.

DOWNLOAD DATA
?	Fully described data.
?	The data itself (in different formats).
- ASCII
- Arc/INFO
- Matlab
- IDL
- NetCDF
- ADF

AUTOMATION

How should DODS be implemented in the southeast?

Anne explained that she was a firm believer in standards and that the group now has an 
opportunity to use DODS as a standard to move data around.  She encouraged all the participants 
to download servers from Peter’s web site and try them out and after that, think about where we 
should go from here.  The goal is to establish a relationship in the end.

Steve listed the major issues that he saw as being important:
1. What are you going to do about metadata, more or less, for DODS?
2. Links to other programs or groups.
3. Include outreach to others not present at the meeting.
4. System installation issues.
5. The need to develop a web browser interface on the client side of DODS.

Based on these issues, the floor was opened up for suggestions/comments:
- Installation nodes, should they be centralized or distributed?
- Time, money (resource availability).
- Time frame, sustaining after initial funding.
- Using DODS needs to be worked into everyday activities.
- Implementation and maintenance issues still need resolving.
- Security issues, PI’s and system people need to be made more comfortable.
- The “O” in DODS was disconcerting for people not interested in oceanography.
- The data model may not be adequate for other fields.
- Data access protocol needs to be generalized.
- The more groups using the DODS data access protocol, and the more tools that each 
community can share with each other, the better.

CONCLUSIONS

Major Metadata Issues:
Listed below are the MAJOR metadata issues that the workshop participants saw as being the 
most important:
?	Define/encourage some “minimal” set of semantic metadata.

- Partnerships with others:
GCMD (Global Change Master Directory)
FGDC
NCDDC
NAML (participate at national level)
Coastwatch
NSF/LABNET/”bubba net”
PMEL
NOAA Server.
Others …
?	FGDC clearinghouse link to DODS.
?	DODS core must go to FGDC clearinghouse metadata.
?	Other repositories of data should be identified and encouraged to use DODS.
?	Investigate links to regional education efforts.

Workshop Summary

General:
$ DODS must work interactively with the FGDC Clearinghouse architecture (Z39.50) and 
metadata standard.
$ Needs to have a stronger front end for locating data.
$ Need servers for relational databases, Excel, Access, SAS, S+.
$ Needs the ability to show a disclaimer BEFORE a user accesses data.
$ Needs interface for both sophisticated and unsophisticated users, local & global 
customer.
$ Auto generation of DODS URLs.

Support:
$ Servers must be easy to install.
$ Provide a help desk for answering questions on installing servers and developing clients.
$ High quality, easy to understand documentation.

Security issues:
$ Document known httpd security issues and make them available to DODS server 
implementers.
$ Ensure DODS software is secure.
$ Provide a means of restricting access to select data through password protection or IP 
exclusion and provide documentation on how to implement this.

Although DODS is middle-ware and does not attempt to provide data location and analysis 
functions, workshop attendees felt that DODS was not terribly useful to them without these.  In 
order to provide these functions better, DODS should partner with other organizations.  Potential 
partners include:
$ Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC).
$ Global Change Master Directory (GCMD).
$ National Association of Marine Laboratories (NAML) LabNet project.
$ NOAA National Coastal Data Development Center (NCDDC).

Suggestions for years 2 and 3

$ Support for installing server.
$ Web browser and direct download for clients.
$ Create a mailing list for SE participants.	
$ The DODS proposal to the National Ocean Partnership Program, roughly 60K would be 
available to the southeast for support.  A suggestion for using these funds would be to 
hire one full-time programmer to  perform the following tasks:
$ Build a web site with information pertinent to DODS users in the southeast.
$ Provide help desk support.
$ Software development (support for web client and DODS URL builder in 
coordination with DODS development team).
$ Coordinate with FGDC.
$ Explore metadata to DODS relationships.
