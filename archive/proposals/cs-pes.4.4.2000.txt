% This is the DODS' section of the PES proposal NSDL proposal. Here's Peter's
% summary: 
%
% For this NSDL project, PES will extend its collaboration with the
% developers of DODS to create user-side software for the Earth Data 
% Real-Time Reference Toolkit. PES will create a user-side GUI that 
% will:
% 
% 1) access data for original as well as "virtual" DODS data sets 
%    (the addition of virtual DODS data sets is the focus of the 
%    DODS portion of this project and is discussed in the next
%    paragraph; a DODS data set is a data set served with a DODS 
%    server);
% 
% 2) develop data-reference visualization tools for MACos and Windows
%    utilizing the EDMI; and,
% 
% 3) provide educational (curricular and instructional) deliverables 
%    that show teachers how use the data within their own courses.

\subsection{Virtual Datasets}

Clients which access the virtual dataset will make queries of a single
composite entity without any need to explicitly access individual components
of that dataset. Virtual datasets will provide a way for data providers
(scientists, national labs, etc.) to organize and present data holdings
without changing the storage architecture of those data.

Virtual datasets will be created by our aggregation server. This new server
will combine existing datasets, already served by DODS, using a configuration
file. Each dataset to be combined will have an entry for the DODS URL of that
dataset. There will be other information in the file, too, including the
spatial relationships between each of the URLs/datasets. By combining the
URLs with the extra information, the aggregation server will be able to
create, and respond to queries on, the virtual dataset.

While the problem of aggregation is very hard in general, DODS' features make
it reasonable for a computer program to handle many less general cases of the
problem. These features include using a general network reference (i.e., URL)
to describe where data are located, a clean and clear separation of datatype
information from other attributes of data and a simple constraint-based
access mechanism. Using a URL to reference data makes it easy to expand a
initial design based on local files to include datasets distributed anywhere
on the Internet.  The clean separation of datatype from other attributes
makes it simpler to create a virtual dataset based on the data component's
datatype signatures---something that computer programs can easily process.
Finally, the constraint-based access mechanism clearly defines the interface
with which the server must interact, both in terms of receiving queries and
in making requests of the data components.

There are two easily identified types of virtual datasets we are considering
in this proposal: Aggregation of similarly typed variables along one or more
axis or dimensions and aggregation of two or more variables of different
types that share an equal set of axis or dimensions. An example of the first
category is a collection of image files, all of the same area but varying in
the time at which the image was captured. The aggregation server would take
such a collection of two dimensional datasets and combine them to create a
single virtual three dimensional dataset. An example of the second type of
virtual dataset is the combination of two or more measured values, currently
held in separate datasets, where the measurements were performed in the same
way (e.g., over the same space and time). 

\subsection{Specific Deliverables}

We propose to implement several distinct aggregation servers, each of which
will be able to serve a broader class of virtual datasets. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item We will build an aggregation server using our current netCDF server and
   client library. The configuration file will itself be a netCDF file and
   will be created using netCDF utilities. The server will be limited to a
   subset of the first category of aggregation servers; it will be able to
   aggregate along one dimension only. Furthermore, this server will be
   limited to array or grid data components. While this server may sound
   limited, there are already many collections of data which can make
   immediate use of this type of server as well as client programs, such as
   Matlab, IDL  and Ferret.
   
 \item We will extend the server to handle the second category of aggregation
   problems. This will be done in concert with technical enhancements of the
   server so that it uses XML to describe the organization of the components
   and so that the bulk of the software uses our DAP C++ class library
   directly.
   
 \item We will further extend the server so that it can handle the general
   case of the first category of aggregation. At this time we will also
   expand support for the aggregation server to include our Java software
   base.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Time Required}

In each case the time required is the time to perform analysis, design,
implementation, documentation, testing and deployment. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item 6 months FTE
\item 9 months FTE
\item 9 months FTE
\end{enumerate}
