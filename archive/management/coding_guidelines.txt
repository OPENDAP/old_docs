Metarule: Adopt the style of the code in which you are working.

Source code should be indented using K&R style (which boils down to 4 spaces
of indent except for case labels which get indented two spaces inside their
switch stmt and braces on the same line as the if, while, et cetera). 

Here's the emacs lisp that sets up K&R indentation. M-C-\ On a region will
re-indent it.

(defun my-c-modes ()			; set block comments for c-mode
    (auto-fill-mode 1)
    (abbrev-mode 1)
    (if window-system
	 (turn-on-font-lock))
    (my-source-code-modes)
    (setq c-basic-offset 4)
    (c-set-offset 'case-label 2)
    (c-set-offset 'statement-case-intro 2))

(add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'my-c-modes)

For functions/methods, layout should be like:

void
function(args)
{
}

Unless they are in a class declaration (C++ header, struct or Java) in which
case they should look like:

void function(args) {
}

Why? Because there's a bunch of source code tools that expect this. And
because we should all use the same basic style.
