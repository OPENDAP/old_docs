\title{DODS---Source Code Checklist}
\author{}
\date{\today}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  
  This document describes the format of source code that is part of the
  \DODS. Following these guidelines will reduce the time spent on problems
  which arise from several different programmers using different conventions
  or from making divergent assumptions about the organization of the
  project's source code. In the discussions here it is assumed that the
  software development environment matches the one described in \SOFT.

\section{Checklist}
\label{walk:checklist}

\begin{itemize}

\item All source files that are written at URI or MIT should have a copyright
  statement at the top of the file. Here is a sample for a \Cpp\ file:
\begin{verbatim}

    // (c) COPYRIGHT URI/MIT 1995-1996
    // Please read the full copyright statement in the file COPYRIGH.  
    //
    // Authors:
    //  jhrg,jimg       James Gallagher (jgallagher@gso.uri.edu)
    //  dan             Dan Holloway (dan@hollywood.gso.uri.edu)
    //  reza            Reza Nekovei (reza@intcomm.net)

\end{verbatim}
\noindent The file {\tt COPYRIGH} (yes, without the {\tt T}; so it will fit
    on those wonderful MS-DODS file systems) is in appendix 
    \ref{walk:copyright}.

\item All files managed by CVS should have a \$Id\$ marker in them so that
  when they are committed to the source archive, the archive copy will have a
  date and version stamp.

\item Files which implement significant portions of a system should have the
  \$Log\$ marker in addition to the \$Id\$ marker.

\item Source code should have file headers that describe the contents
  of the file and who created it.

\item Source code should contain comments for each member function or
  function that describes what it does, how it works, and what it
  returns. When the operation of a member/function is obvious, there is no
  need to add the comment (e.g., a simple accesser for a \Cpp\ class's
  private member does not need a comment).

\item C and \Cpp\ headers ({\tt *.h} files) should contain the following at
  their top and bottom:
  \begin{verbatim}
    #ifndef _filename_
    #define _filename_


    #endif /* _filename_ */
\end{verbatim}

\item Source code should be easy to read; it should use some recognized type
  of formatting. The program {\tt indent} will indent source code to one of
  three standard styles. 

\item Check comment text for spelling errors.

\item Make sure that source code makes use of assertions.

\item Make sure that source code makes use of dynamic memory debugging tools.

\end{itemize}
