We assume the following tools are available for the development environment.
For supported machines, using these guarantees that you will be able to
build DODS software. On unsupportted machines these tools improve your
chances, but do not guarantee anything. Most of the software listed here is
developed and maintained by others. Even though DODS will make them
available on the same ftp site as DODS software, we won't try to maintain
them. We will, however, try to keep up with the latest releases of these
packages.
