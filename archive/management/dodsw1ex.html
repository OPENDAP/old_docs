<title>DODS Workshop 1 --Executive Summary</title>
<h1>DODS Workshop 1 --Executive Summary</h1><p>

The Oceanography Society, with funding from NASA and NOAA, is planning
a workshop series to define the structure of a client-server based
distributed system for access to oceanographic data over the Internet
and to develop and test a prototype.  The underlying idea of such a
system is that individual scientists as well as national archives will
become providers of data.  Any scientist or archive willing to make
their data generally available over the network would install a server
on their CPU providing access to their data. Researchers would then be
able to obtain any of the data available to this system through a
client running on their own CPU.<p>

The series will consist of three workshops.<p>

The first workshop was held at the University of Rhode Island's Alton
Jones Campus from 28 September to 1 October 1993, reported herein. The
first day was dedicated to questions related to system architecture.
The second day focused on communication objects and the third on
defining a prototype based on the previous day's discussions. A system
programmer hired as part of this effort will be responsible for
implementing the prototype.<p>

The second workshop will be held in the summer of 1994. It will focus 
on progress made in implementing the plans/issues discussed in the first 
workshop or problems encountered in this. In particular, the prototype 
outlined in the first meeting will be presented and discussed with some 
data sets. At this point it should be clear what needs to be done at 
each data archive site. Following the second workshop, the programmer 
will go for short periods to the participants' labs to help them get 
things going or will work with them over the Internet.<p>

The third workshop will be held at the next TOS meeting, late spring 1995. 
Its purpose will be to present the model to the oceanographic community.<p>

The workshops will be run administratively by The Oceanography Society. 
Scientific direction will be provided by a steering committee consisting 
of Glenn Flierl of MIT, Ken MacDonald of NASA (EOSDIS), Jim Holbrook of 
NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory and Peter Cornillon of the 
University of Rhode Island.<p>

This is the report of the first workshop, intended to begin the
development of a Distributed Oceanographic Data System (DODS). The
body of the report is a summary with liberal interpretation of the
proceedings of the workshop. Appendix I is a list of requirements that
was abstracted from the minutes of the workshop (Appendix II) and from
the flip charts developed in each of the breakout groups.<p>

During the meeting, we developed a set of requirements --- what the
users and data providers would like to see from a DODS. These can be
summarized as follows:<p>

<ul>
<li> To be successful, scientists must find the system useful and turn
to it when they wish to collect data together for their research. This
implies that the system must provide access to both archive and PI--held
data sets. It must be easy and natural to work with, not only for
other persons' data but for their own as well. The system must provide
simple ways for scientists to distribute their data and to submit it
to the archive centers.<p>

<li> The system must make it easy to locate the appropriate information.
Various procedures for searching, browsing, and refining searches must
be possible.<p>

<li> Interfaces for programming languages must be provided so that
data can be incorporated directly into analysis routines. The system
must support multiple interfaces, from simple commands to a GUI.<p>

<li> To be successful, archive centers must perceive the system as a
good way for individuals to retrieve information from their archives.
In addition, it should encourage and facilitate submission of dat.<p>

<li> The system must be easy to install and extensible (meaning that new
servers, new data types, new browsing procedures, new user interfaces,
new data filters, ... can be added at any time).<p>

</ul>
Originally it was intended that the architecture to be used for this
system would be defined at the workshop. This was however
not practical given the time available, and discussions with regard to 
system architecture begun at the meeting have continued in the 
interim. Appendix III contains a brief outline of the three different 
systems under consideration. The prototyping effort has begun and the
communications structure for the system is being defined and
implemented.<p>

Everyone involved in the meeting with an Internet address was placed on 
a distribution list. The purpose of this list was for messages of very 
broad interest to the group such as when the next meeting would be held. 
In addition, several participants expressed an interest in being involved 
in the more detailed discussions related to the development of the DODS 
that were to follow the meeting. A smaller distribution list was formed for 
this group. Some of the discussions alluded to in the previous paragraph 
have taken place via this list. There has also been some discussion 
in this forum related to data structures. Anyone interested in being added 
to the DODS distribution list should contact Jim Gallagher 
(jimg@zeno.gso.uri.edu).<p>

Each participant was asked to prepare a short summary of their current 
interests. Appendix IV contains these summaries. Appendix V is a 
listing of the participants.
