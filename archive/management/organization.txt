Currently DODS is not very structured as a group and this has suited us well.
However, I think some structure is emerging and formally recognizing that
will make it simpler for us to do our work.

I see four groups forming:

  Software development: 
	Myself, Dan, Reza*, Deirdre*, Rob*, Nathan*, Brent*, Chris* 

  Data/Population:
	Paul, Kwok Lin

  Support/Documentation:
	Tom, Ethan
  
  Liaison:
	Lynn Halpern (GCMD)
	Steve Hankin (Ferret/PMEL)
	Elaine Dobinson (JPL)
	Peter Fox (UCAR)
