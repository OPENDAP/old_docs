DODS mailing lists

There are two DODS mailing lists; one for the workshop participants that are
interested in reports and important updates, and one for people who want to
take a more active role in the development of the DODS. The later list will
likely contain day-to-day traffic between Peter, Glenn, George and myself.

The report and updates list is `dods-report@dcz.gso.uri.edu'. To be added or
removed from the list, send a message to
`dods-report-request@dcz.gso.uri.edu' asking to be added or removed from the
list. To send a message to all the recipients of the list use the address
`dods-report@dcz.gso.uri.edu'. This is intended to be a low traffic list.

The discussion list is `dods@dcz.gso.uri.edu'. To be added or removed from
that list, send a message to `dods-request@dcz.gso.uri.edu'. To send a
message to all the recipients of the list send to `dods@dcz.gso.uri.edu'.

Initially all the workshop attendees who gave email addresses will be added
to the `dods-report' list while no one other than Peter, Glenn, George and
myself will be members of the `dods' list. If you don't want to receive the
dods-report mailings, send a message to dods-report-request asking to be
removed from the list. by the same token, if you want to be added to the
discussion list (dods), send a message to dods-request asking to be added.
